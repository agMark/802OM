<p> Install gusset on lower side of landing gear attach tube assembly as shown in <xref fileTarget="img_REPAIRMainGearAttachTube.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> and weld all around per PS144. In lieu of placing in a cool down box following completion of welding, wrap an insulated welders blanket around the area for the cool down period.
