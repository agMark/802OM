<p> Any accident such as a ground loop that causes one of the main gear springs to be replaced due to deformation 
also requires that the other gear spring be replaced. This is due to the probability that the “good” spring has 
been over-stressed and history has proved that both gear springs should be replaced if one has been 
deformed.</p>
