<p>
There is a
difference in the structural requirement of fuselage skins as opposed to wing and tail surface
skins. The skins of the fuselage are not primary structure and the tolerance for damage in
fuselage skins is greater than that of stressed skin design of wing and tail surface skins.
</p>

<p><b>Acceptable Limits of Damage for Skins</b></p>

<p>
    Wing, flap, aileron, horizontal stabilizer, elevator, fin and rudder skins are acceptable for
continued service with small dents and or light scratches. Small dents are those that do not
exceed ¼" deep and 2" in diameter, are smooth (without sharp edges or deep scratches).
Scratches should be no deeper than 1/4 of the skin material thickness. Any cracks in these skins
should be repaired with the guidance of AC-43.13 or the skin replaced.
</p>

<p>
    Since the primary structure of the fuselage is the 4130 steel fuselage frame tubing the
skins are not as critical. Dents as deep as ½" and as large as 4" in diameter are allowable.
Scratches as deep as 1/2 the thickness of the skin material is also allowable. Cracks in fuselage
skins that do not exceed 1" in length are also allowable.
</p>

<p>
    Any known damage as described above shall be monitored by visual inspections to
ensure that they do not grow past the allowable limits, and as a matter of good practice we
recommend that any damaged skins be repaired or replaced during the off season. They may be
repaired as described below.
</p>

<p><b>Repairing Negligible Damage</b></p>

<p>
    On repairs of negligible damage Air Tractor has used the Aviation Maintenance
Technician Handbook Airframe, Volume 1, from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal
Aviation Administration, for guidance. Under these guidelines negligible damage consist of
visually apparent surface damage that does not affect the structural integrity of the component
involved.
</p>

<p>
    Negligible damage may be left as is or may be corrected by a simple procedure without
restricting flight. In both cases, some corrective action must be taken to keep the damage from
spreading. Negligible or minor damage areas must be inspected frequently to ensure the damage
does not spread. Permissible limits for negligible damage vary for different components of
different aircraft and should be carefully researched on an individual basis. Failure to ensure that
damages within the specified limit of negligible damage may result in insufficient structural
strength of the affected support member for critical flight conditions.
</p>

<p>
    Small dents, scratches, cracks, and holes that can be repaired by smoothing, sanding, stop
drilling, or hammering out, or otherwise repaired without the use of additional materials, fall in
this classification.
