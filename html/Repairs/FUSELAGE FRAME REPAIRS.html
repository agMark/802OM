<P>The most common cause of fuselage frame damage is a landing gear strike during spraying operations, or
    hitting an obstruction during take-off.</P>

<p>When a severe drag load is placed on the main gear leg and due to the leverage that exists, either the tubular
    structure is damaged or else the forward clamp block bolt fails. If the tubular structure is severely damaged it
    is best to contact the factory with photos or sketches of the damaged tubes, and a repair cluster can be
    constructed at the factory which can be spliced in a convenient location with external sleeves.</p>

<p>It is seldom necessary to place the fuselage frame in the original jig, as shop aids can be sent with the repair
    structure, and with careful measurements, the structure will be back to the original configuration. Repair
    clusters are designed so that gas welding can usually be used to install the new cluster.</p>

<p>The forward section of the fuselage frame, in the area where the main landing gear is attached, is heat treated
    for strength. Therefore, no field weld repairs are to be made to this area unless authorized by the factory. Many
    of the welded attach fittings are stress relieved. Weld repairs to these are acceptable, as long as the welds are
    stress relieved according to PS125. All other areas of the frame may be repaired by tig or gas welding in the
    field. Use FAA AC 43.13 us a guide to general weld repairs.</p>

<p>After welding, clean, sand, etch, prime and finish coat as described under <xref sectionTarget="2.105.3" prependLabel="Section"></xref></p>
