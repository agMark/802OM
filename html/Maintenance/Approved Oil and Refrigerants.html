<p><b>R-12 Systems</b></p>
<p>Compressor clutches and compressor-clutch magnets are no longer available from the manufacturer for the original R-12
    air conditioner system. Since there are still many of these units in service, Air Tractor has an alternate clutch
    available. The original R-12 clutch is easily identified by the double "V" belt pulley grooves.  To install the P/N 25-8502-24 clutch on your aircraft, refer to Service Letter
    #181.
</p>
<p>If your R-12 air conditioning system requires servicing, we suggest that you convert the system to R-134a refrigerant according
    to Service Letter #159.
