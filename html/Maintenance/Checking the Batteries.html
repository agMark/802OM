<p>Always wear protective clothing, rubber gloves, and a face shield when servicing batteries. The batteries are checked by determining the level of the electrolyte in each cell. First of all the battery caps are removed. Then each cell is inspected individually. Using a light if necessary, the electrolyte level should be observed at or slightly above the plastic split-ring that is visible through the filling hole. </p>

<p>If the electrolyte fluid level is low and adding fluid is necessary, the electrolyte level can be raised by adding distilled water. The battery should not be overfilled. The electrolyte level should not be more than one-quarter inch above the split ring.</p>

<p>When a battery seems weak or will not hold a charge after charging, replacing the battery may be necessary. The charge capacity of individual cells may be determined by checking the specific-gravity of the electrolyte in those cells. </p>

<p>The specific-gravity check can be done with the use of a hydrometer constructed of acid-resistant materials. The specific-gravity should range from 1.1 for a fully-discharged cell to 1.3 for a fully-charged cell. a specific-gravity of 1.260 or more is considered an adequate charge. A specific-gravity of less than 1.260 indicates charging is required. A variance of specific-gravity more than 0.1 from other cells in the battery is an indication of a weak cell and the battery should be replaced. A specific-gravity reading of 1.285 to 1.295 indicates a fully charged cell. </p>

<p>Commercial battery hydrometers are normally used for specific-gravity checks. These hydrometers may display specific-gravity readings or might have red and green bands. Depending on the state of charge, the specific-gravity readings should not be interpreted as absolute but as comparative readings with other cells in the battery. A single cell whose specific-gravity reading is at wide variances with other cells in the battery suggests a dead cell requiring replacement of the battery. </p>

<p>To check a G-246 (G-246AT) battery, first disconnect it from the other batteries and make sure that it is fully charged. Connect a 38-amp load to the battery and monitor the battery voltage. A 38 amp load can be obtained by connecting two 240 watt, GE 4580, lamps in parallel. If after 24 minutes the battery voltage is at least 21 Volts or more, the battery is serviceable. While the battery is loaded, monitor the electrolyte in the cells. Electrolyte boiling in a cell indicates a bad cell. Replace the battery if it fails to meet this requirement. If the battery passes this test, recharge it before returning it to service. </p>
