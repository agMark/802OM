    It is recommended that the technician have a padded bench top or table nearby to lay the removed elevator halves onto. It is also highly encouraged that a second person assist with the removal and installation of the elevator halves in order to prevent damage to the aircraft or surfaces.

<p><b>Removal</b></p> 

<ol>
    <li>
        Use the gust lock to hold the control stick in a fixed position.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the aftmost left and right skins for access.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the rudder assembly as described in <xref sectionTarget="2.45.9" xrefType="link", prependLabel="Section"></xref>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disconnect the bolt, washers and nut from the rear connection point of the elevator trim tab pushrods.  Move the pushrods out of the way to make sure that there is no interference with further steps.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the bolt, washers and nut from the rear elevator pushrod connection with the left and right elevator horn plates. This will be the lowest hole located in the elevator horn plates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the bolt, washers and nut directly above the pushrod connection holes joining the left and right elevator horn plates together. Note that there is also a center bushing as part of this attachment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the bolt, washers and nut from the left and right elevator horn plates where they connect to the stabilizer rear spar mount. The bolt at this attachment point passes through a spherical bearing. Once this bolt has been removed, the elevator halves should be mechanically separate from each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the nuts and washers at each hinge point for the elevator half.
        <div class="boxCautionSmall">
            <p class="boxCautionSmallHeader">CAUTION</p>
            <p class="boxCautionSmallText">Be especially aware of risk of pinching fingers, hands or arms during this step.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        If a second person is available for assistance, have them support the weight and position of the elevator half while the other technician removes the bolts from the hinge points. It may require some amount of rotation in order for the elevator half horn plate to clear the hole in the top aft skin. Repeat this step for removal of the other elevator half.

    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Now is a good time to inspect the hinge bearings for condition and security. If any substantial repairs affecting the weight are made to the elevator halves, the surfaces may need to have the balance checked before reinstallation (See <xref sectionTarget="2.31" prependLabel="Section"></xref>). Elevator half reinstallation is the reverse of the steps listed above.

<p>Replacement is reverse of removal.</p>
