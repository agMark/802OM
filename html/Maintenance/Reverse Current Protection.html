<p>If the S/G voltage drops below the Bus voltage (battery) due to normal conditions such as engine shut down or abnormal conditions such as loss of field excitation the S/G will draw reverse current (discharge the battery). The GCU senses this condition via pin D that is connected to terminal D of the S/G. Terminal D output is a positive voltage proportional to reverse current. </p>
