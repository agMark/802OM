<p>The wiring schematic for the hopper quantity gauges is shown in Figure 43. The hopper-quantity circuitry provides hopper quality information on the pilotâ€™s instrument panel. The optional external hopper-quantity gauges may be located on either or both sides of the fuselage, aft of the wing, easily visible from the single-point hopper fill locations. All of the gauges are normally calibrated in gallons. The gauge may be calibrated in liters at customer option. The external gauges are designed to assist the ground crew in filling the hopper. </p>

<p>The cockpit gauge is a solid-state display whose characters are generated within the display case. The external gauges are digital repeats of the cockpit gauge. If re-calibration of the cockpit gauge is required, refer to Report 0707, which is furnished in the Appendix of this manual. </p>

<p>In Figure 43, the Hopper Fill Gauge, near the lower left-hand corner of the drawing, is actually a potentiometer that is connected to the hopper float. This potentiometer transmits the analog hopper quantity information to the hopper-contents digital display case. Circuitry within the display case converts this analog signal to a digital signal that is displayed on the panel digital display. </p>
