<p>If the micro-switches appear OK the flap motor may be checked as follows:</p>

<ol type=”1”>
    <li>Slide the conduit down from the wire splice (Wristlock) where the red and black wires go into the wire bundle.</li>

    <li>Note which wires the black wire from the motor connects to.</li>

    <li>Use an outside source of power (24 volts) protected with a circuit breaker. Attach the negative power 	source to the red wire and attach the positive wire through the circuit breaker to the black wire. The motor should run in one direction. Attach the positive wire through the circuit breaker to the red motor wire and the negative wire to the black motor wire. The motor should run in the other direction.</li>

    <li>If the motor on a C100168-4 actuator does not respond as described above, it is faulty and should be replaced.  It is attached to the actuator by two 1032 nuts. Be sure rubber coupling is in good condition  </li>
