<p>
    As a general rule if the Starter Generator functions normally in the Start mode there 
    will be nothing wrong with it that would prevent it from functioning in the Generate mode.
</p>

<p>
    Before attempting to correct any problem with this system first read and understand 
    <xref fileTarget="html/Maintenance/Starting and Charging.html" prependLabel="Section"></xref> 
    and acquaint yourself with the location and function of the various 
    components. Look for obvious problems such as overheating, burned wires, loose components, and loose 
    electrical connections. Disconnect the GCU Cannon plug and inspect it and all other electrical connections for 
    corrosion. Correct any of these problems before proceeding.
</p>

<p><b>Equipment</b></p>
<p>
    Equipment recommended for troubleshooting the charging system is shown below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A multimeter capable of .01V resolution in the 0-2.5V range, .15V resolution in the 0-30V range 
        and capable of reading from a fraction of an ohm to several kilohms will be required. 
        An autoranging digital instrument is ideal but any good quality until will work. For point-to-point ringout, the 
        ohmmeter function will be used.
    </li>
    <li>
        GCU Breakout Box- This is not absolutely essential but it is very effective in localizing many problems. 
        It can be fabricated per <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_45.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below or it is available from your dealer.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Troubleshooting Procedures</b></p>

<p><b>Static Tests</b></p>
<p>
    Before going into specific symptoms, which will result in, operational squawks it is productive to 
    point out a static test routine that is quick and easy and will result in localizing some problems without starting 
    the engine.

<p>Set Master Switch to OFF and Generator Switch to ON and check the following:</p>
