<p><b>To gain access to and inspect the quill shaft and drive pad bearings:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Remove the necessary engine cowl skins to gain access to the air conditioner compressor and compressor drive.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the safety wire from the belt tensioning turnbuckle and adjust the turnbuckle to loosen the drive belt.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the hardware attaching the compressor to the compressor mounting lugs of the drive pad, including the turnbuckle brace.  Remove the compressor but do not disconnect hoses.  <u>The system does not need to be evacuated to accomplish this inspection.</u>
    </li>
    <li>
        For drive pads with removable pulley, remove may be helpful to remove the pulley by removing the bolt and washer from the end and then loosening the set screw.
    </li>
    <li>
        For oil bath type drive pad assemblies (51628-1), remove all plugs and drain the oil.  Inspect the oil for metal and contamination.  If the oil is very dirty, the drive pad assembly will need to be flushed with solvent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the safety wire from the bolts securing the drive pad assembly to the drive pad.  Remove the drive pad assembly.
    </li>

    <li>
        Remove the retaining ring to remove the quill shaft from the drive pad assembly. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Clean the quill shaft and the pulley shaft.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect engine and pulley shaft's internal splines for corrosion and wear.  If there is corrosion present, remove it.  If the splines are worn, the component should be replaced.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect the quill shaft for wear.  The quill shaft is made of a material that is softer than its mating components so it will typically wear first.  If the quill shaft is badly worn, it should be replaced.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect bearings.  Rotate the pulley end of the shaft and listen for noise or rough spots.  The shaft should turn smoothly with no rough or tight spots.  If bearings are bad, proceed to overhaul the drive pad assembly per <xref sectionTarget="2.50.42" prependLabel="Section">Cross Reference Placeholder</xref>.
    </li>
    <li>
        For oil bath type drive pads, inspect pulley shaft seal for tears or damage.  Replace if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect condition of drive pad o-rings.  Replace if damaged.
    </li>
</ol>

<p><b>To lubricate and reinstall:</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>
        For dry spline drive pads (See <xref sectionTarget="2.50.40" prependLabel="Section">Cross Reference Placeholder</xref>), pack the inside of the engine and pulley shaft's internal splines with high temperature molybdenum disulfide grease.  See MIL-G-25760 or PWC Service Bulletin 14458 for acceptable grease.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reinstall quill shaft into pulley shaft and reinstall retaining ring.
    </li>
    <li>
        For sealed type drive pad assemblies 
        (See <xref sectionTarget="2.50.40" prependLabel="Section">Cross Reference Placeholder</xref>), 
        install new AS3209-113 o-rings on quill shaft.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reinstall drive pad assembly opposite of removal above.
    </li>
    <li>
        For oil bath type drive pads 
        (See <xref sectionTarget="2.50.40" prependLabel="Section">Cross Reference Placeholder</xref>)
        , fill with turbine engine oil until oil just runs out of level plug hole.  Install oil level plug and breather plug assembly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reinstall compressor and belts, re-tension belt and install safety wire.
    </li>
</ol>
