<p>Details of the wing's front-spar and rear-spar attachments to the fuselage are shown below. </p>

<p>Two aluminum and two steel wing-attach angles are used to attach the wing main spar to the fuselage vertical tube just aft of the main spar. There are four AN6-31A bolts that attach each vertical tube to the wing angles. </p>

<p>It should also be noted that there is no bolt through the attach angle and through the small leg of the lower spar cap. This is to eliminate bolt fretting and make the joint more fatigue resistant. </p>

<p>The wing attach angles are p/n 20605-1 (aluminum) and p/n 20475-1 (steel). They are attached to the main spar with six AN6-15A and two AN6-16A bolts. If it is necessary to change the wing attach angles due to bolt wear or fuselage repairs, ask the factory for detailed instructions on how to drill the attach angles at the time they are ordered, as these angles are drilled to match each individual aircraft. </p>

<p>The rear spar plate is attached to the fuselage frame with a single NAS1309-25 bolt. These bolts wear slightly and should be checked at 1,000 hour intervals, and replaced if worn or rusty. Do not use AN bolts at this location. To remove the bolts, first remove the lower wing gap cover, which is attached with screws. Removal detail of the gap cover is shown below. </p>

<p>Any time an Air Tractor plane suffers damage to the leading edge of a wing the associated rear spar attaching structure needs to be carefully inspected for damage. The rear spar connecting bolt should be replaced. The wing rear spar plate connection to the rear spar should also be carefully inspected. Cracks in the paint or the sealer where the plate attaches to the rear spar are indications of possible damage.</p>

<p>If your plane has suffered wing damage from striking an obstacle such as a pole or a wire, or other accident damage, be sure that the wing rear spar attaching structure is inspected carefully for damage. Failure to detect and repair damage to the rear spar attaching structure that could have been caused by other wing damage may result in subsequent wing separation from the plane in flight.</p>

<p>Place a small hydraulic jack under the wing rear spar plate and apply only a small amount of pressure to support the wing when the bolt is removed. Lock the parking brake so the aircraft will not move. Remove the nut and drive the bolt out with a small hammer gently, protecting the threads from damage. Inspect the bolt visually, then place it on a smooth plate and rotate to see if it is bent. Inspect for thread damage or rust. Do not use excessive force to remove the bolts, and do not heat. If there is difficulty in removing the bolts, contact the factory. </p>

<p>We encourage replacement of old bolts with new bolts at all times, but if the old bolts are in good shape and the time intervals mentioned above are not exceeded, they may be re-installed. Be sure to grease the bolts with MIL-G-81322 grease before installing. Torque values are 1100 inch-pounds (Torque wrench on nut). </p>
