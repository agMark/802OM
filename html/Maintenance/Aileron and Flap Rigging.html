<b>Aileron and FLap Rigging</b>

<p>When rigging the ailerons, set the control lock and adjust the two 70554-1 Idlers lean inboard 3-1/2 °, which will position the Idler 90° to the aileron push tube inside the wing. </p>
<p>With the flap actuator in the UP position, the flap push-rods are adjusted so that the lower side of the flaps form a straight line with the lower side of the fuel tank at station 109.0. Flap travel from this point is then set at 30° +/- 1.5°.  Flap markings on the flap are located opposite the wing flap bay upper skin so that the pilot will view the markings at 10°, 20°, and at full travel. </p>
<p>The ailerons are rigged with the trailing edge 1/8” to 3/16” below the flap trailing edge so that flight loads will bring the trailing edge up approximately even with the flap trailing edge. Aileron travel (with flaps up) is 17° up (+/- 1°) and 13° down (+/- 1°). Aileron control stops are located under the cockpit floor on each side of the control stick torque tube horn. Additional up-aileron stops are located in the wing at the aileron bellcrank. The adjustment consists of tightening or loosening the bolts that compress a stack of 4 to 6 neoprene washers (p/n 70067-1). The neoprene washers act as shock absorbers for the control system, but sometimes split and fall out, so it is advisable to inspect the stops and replace the neoprene washers as necessary during 12-month inspections. </p>
