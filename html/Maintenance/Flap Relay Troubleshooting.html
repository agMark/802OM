<p>If the micro-switches and the flap motor appear OK then the trouble may be in the relays. Details of the flap relays
  are shown in the figure below.</P>

<p>With the master switch on use of a voltmeter to check that there is power to the relays at the -299 and -235 wires.
  If there is battery voltage there, have someone attempt to extend and retract the flaps with the flap switch while
  checking for battery voltage at the relay coils, wire -236 and -238 for down and up respectively. If there is no
  battery voltage when the flap switch is activated check the micro-switches and the flap switch. If there is battery
  voltage at the respective relay coils when the flap switch is activated you should hear the relay “click" and the flap
  motor should operate. If the relay “clicks" and the flap motor does not operate, check for battery voltage at the
  motor. If there is not battery voltage at the motor when the relay clicks the relay contacts are probably bad and the
  relay should be replaced. If the relay does not click turn off the master switch, remove one of the coil wires and
  check the coil with an Ohmmeter. The relay coil terminals are the two smaller studs (# 10) on the relay case. The
  resistance through the 70-317224-5-relay coil should be about 59 ohms. Use the Ohmmeter to check that the relay coil
  is not shorted to ground. If the coil is bad replace the relay.

<b>FLAP ACTUATOR (71112-1) OVERHAUL</b>

<p>The flap actuator should be replaced or overhauled after 1500 hours of service to assure trouble free operation. If
  it is to be overhauled order a kit of parts from your dealer. The Overhaul kit part no. is 71112-1-500 and consists of
  the following parts: </p>

<p>The 71112-1 flap actuator should be replaced or overhauled at the factory or in a factory approved facility after
  1500 hours of service to assure trouble free operation. If the actuator stops functioning, first check to ensure that
  there is no binding or seized parts in the entire flap system. Also, ensure the limit switches are functioning and set
  properly. </p>

<p>Second, inspect the gearbox for correct operation. To do this, first remove the flap motor from the actuator gearbox
  by removing two nuts from the end of the motor closest to the actuator gearbox. Then turn the gearbox input shaft by
  hand and ensure that the gearbox and the ballscrew shaft turns without binding or roughness. If there is any binding
  or roughness, then the gearbox needs to be replaced or factory-overhauled. </p>

<p>Next, check the motor for proper operation by having someone operate the flap switch in the cockpit. Try the switch
  in both directions (Note that if the flaps are in the full up or full down position, the motor will not turn in both
  directions because a limit switch will be depressed). </p>

<p>If it is determined that the motor is not functioning properly, remove and inspect the spring loaded motor brushes
  for excessive wear. Excessive wear is defined as a brush that has worn down to a length of 1/8" or less. If this is
  the case, P/N 03-057 replacement brushes can be purchased from your dealer (2 required for each motor). For a
  replacement motor, order P/N 90-1026 from your dealer. </p>

<b>ACTUATOR OVERHAUL STEPS </b>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Save and reuse all hardware unless otherwise specified. </li>
  <li>Remove and inspect the 90-1026 flap motor. Replace on condition. Replace the motor brushes with P/N 03-057
    replacement brushes from Specialty Motors. </li>
  <li>Inspect flap actuator attach arms (Item 12 on Dwg 71112). Replace on condition.</li>
  <li>Remove 4 screws and endcap from gearbox. Drain gearbox oil through a strainer. Check for metal particles.
    Specifically check for brass particles that might indicate excessive worm gear wear. </li>
  <li>Remove 8 screws and carefully remove the 71147-1 actuator shaft form the gearbox. Remove the cotter pin and bolt
    from the end of the shaft and remove all parts from the shaft (when removing the ball screw; thread it off of the
    shaft and onto a cardboard shipping tube to prevent the loss of the ball bearings). Discard the ball bearing
    (PS3KDD), the roller bearing (00050 and 00150), and the seal (7410), and the O-Ring MS35333-39). Clean and inspect
    the remaining parts.</li>
  <li>Check the 71118-1 worm gear for any gouging or excessive wear on the teeth. Check the 71154-1 bronze bearing for
    excessive wear (excessive wear is defined as the bearing being thinner than .040" at the center.) Check the 71117-1
    ballscrew shaft dimensions. Replace all discarded parts with new parts to accurately set the shaft dimensions.
    Inspect.</li>
  <li>Rebuild the 71147-1 actuator shaft per Drawing 71147. Use the T71147-1 and T71147-2 tooling to accurately set the
    shaft dimensions. Replace all discarded parts with new parts. Inspect. </li>
  <li>Remove the half of the 71130-1 spider coupling that is attached to the worm shaft. Inspect all three pieces of the
    spider coupling and replace any unserviceable parts. Using the SK655-1 seal pulling tool, remove and discard the
    CR3725 seal from the gearbox. Remove and discard the WHM-87 retaining ring. Remove the worm shaft from the gearbox.
    Remove all parts from the shaft. Discard the cotter pin (MS24665-132) and bearings (PS3KDD and RA4Z). Clean and
    inspect the remaining parts. Check the GLUH worm for any gouging or excessive wear. Discard unserviceable parts.
  </li>
  <li>Rebuild the 71148-1 worm shaft per Drawing 71148, replacing all discarded parts with new parts. Inspect.</li>
  <li>Inspect the 71125-1 gearbox and P37-8 bushing for serviceability. Discard and replace unserviceable parts.</li>
  <li>Rebuild the actuator per Drawing 71112, replacing all discarded parts with new parts.</li>
