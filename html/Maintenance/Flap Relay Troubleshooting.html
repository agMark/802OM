<p>If the micro-switches and the flap motor appear OK then the trouble may be in the relays. Details of the flap relays
  are shown in the figure below.</P>

<p>When the optional rear seat flap switch is installed, the switch wiring is modified as shown below.</p>

<p>With the master switch on use of a voltmeter to check that there is power to the relays at the 88a contact.
  If there is battery voltage there, have someone attempt to extend and retract the flaps with the flap switch while
  checking for battery voltage at the relay coils. If there is no
  battery voltage when the flap switch is activated check the micro-switches and the flap switch(s). If there is battery
  voltage at the respective relay coils when the flap switch is activated you should hear the relay “click" and the flap
  motor should operate. If the relay “clicks" and the flap motor does not operate, check for battery voltage at the
  motor. If there is not battery voltage at the motor when the relay clicks the relay contacts are probably bad and the
  relay should be replaced. If the relay does not click turn off the master switch, remove one of the coil wires and
  check the coil with an Ohmmeter. The relay coil terminals are the two smaller studs on the relay case. The
  resistance through the relay coil should be about 59 ohms. Use the Ohmmeter to check that the relay coil
  is not shorted to ground. If the coil is bad replace the relay.
