<p>We have had some service difficulties with the PFT GCU related to the MS3106A-19-22S Cannon Plug Connector. There have been several failures of the GCU caused by poor contact between the male pins on the GCU connector and the Female pins in the wiring harness connector. We recommend that you replace the MS3106A-19 22S connector on the wiring harness in your aircraft with an MS3106E-19 22S connector. The MS3106E- 19-22S connector is environmentally sealed and the female connector pins are of a better design. These female pins make better contact than those in the MS3106A-19-22S connector. The MS3106E-19-22S connector is available from your dealer along with the 60363 wiring diagram at no charge. More information can be found in Service Letter #131.</p>
