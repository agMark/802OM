<p>The master cylinders are Cleveland p/n 10-86A. The lower end is bolted to aluminum straps connected to the rudder pedal. Both the strap and the pedal have bronze bushings that can be replaced when worn. The bushings are oil-impregnated and do not require lubrication. Details of the brake master cylinders are shown below. </p>

<p>The lower end of the master cylinder is attached to a Parker clevis with a Parker check nut. If the rudder pedal position (angle) should need changing for pilot comfort, the check nut can be loosened, and the Clevis immediately below can be rotated with finger pressure in either direction to increase or decrease the angle that the brake pedal makes with the cockpit floor. When desired angle is obtained, snug check nut. To remove the master cylinder, loosen check nut and rotate plunger out of the clevis. Then removing the bolt attaching the master cylinder to the steel plates and disconnect the two brake lines at the cylinder. </p>

<p>There have had reports from two Air Tractor owners that the eyebolt that screws into the brake master cylinder broke in the threads, causing immediate loss of braking on the affected side. This issue could result in losing directional control of the aircraft during taxi, takeoff or landing. This issue affected serial numbers -0001 through -0064.
</p>

<p>Parker Hannifin Corporation has responded with a modification which should resolve the condition. The modification consists of threading the outside of the piston rod instead of the inside, and providing a clevis with a female thread to attach to the piston rod. This results in a much stronger attachment to the master cylinder.
</p>

<p>The part number for this upgraded master cylinder is 10-86A. More information can be found in Service Letter #166.</p>

<p>To prevent the brake master cylinder clevis from disengaging from the master cylinder piston rod, it is recommended that the master cylinder piston rod clevis and check nut be inspected to ensure that the rod threads are properly engaged in the clevis internal threads and that the check nut is properly torqued. There is a thread engagement inspection hole in the side of the clevis. Insert piece of safety wire in the hole to determine if the piston rod is screwed into the clevis at least as far as the hole. 
</p>

<p>Finally, verify that the clevis and check nut on the master cylinder piston rod have been assembled with Loctite 242 (Blue). If not yet accomplished, the assembly is to be done according to Drawing 70523 and/or Service Letter #332.</p>

<p>It has been determined that serial numbers -0001 through -0037 possess the possibility for the rudder pedals to flop over. When this happens the top of the pedal moves aft and comes to rest on the floor of the aircraft. The pilot has no control of the brakes when this occurs and ground control can be difficult. On some models the top of the pedal may become lodged between the hopper and the floor. This would hold the rudder deflected over to one side. To remedy this situation it is usually a simple matter of the pilot hooking the pedal with his toe and standing it back up. To prevent the rudder pedals from rotating too far over, Air Tractor has designed a pedal stop. Refer to Service Letter #156 to correct this issue.</p>

<p>A repair kit is available for the master cylinder which is Cleveland p/n 199-521.  The cylinder may be disassembled and repair parts installed per instructions furnished with kit.  If the check nut at the bottom is left in the original position, the pedal angle will be the same as before when the master cylinder is re-installed.  Be sure the cylinder is free to swing through the full range of rudder pedal travel.  If it does not, the two plates which attach the cylinder are too close together and require an additional spacer washer. </p>

<p>If a spot of brake fluid appears on the cockpit floor on the L/H side it does not necessarily mean that the master cylinder is leaking.  The usual cause is over-filling the brake reservoir, so that when brakes are used, and fluid returns to the reservoir, it sometimes leaks through the vent hole in the reservoir cap. </p>
