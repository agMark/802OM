<p>The placards installed adjacent to the wing’s fuel filler ports on all turbine engine models may refer only to “Jet A” or “Jet A1”, which is not a complete listing of permissible fuels. To avoid confusion, a new adhesive placard that refers to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) for a full listing of approved fuels and additives has been created. </p>
<p>To order or install these additional placards, refer to Service Letter #381.</p>
