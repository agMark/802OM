<p><b>Flushing Notes</b></p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Equipment Types
        <p>Refrigerant recovery recycle machines which contain a flushing circulating pump to solvent- clean
            using
            R134a.</p>
        <p>A closed loop flushing machine in which the circulated flushing fluid is returned to a reservoir for
            filtering and
            continued circulation. Most of these machines provide a pulsing action to dislodge particles that
            are
            stuck
            in small
            passageways.</p>
        <p>A pressurized flush gun with a pulsating spray can also be used. To use this technique, block one end
            of
            a
            air
            conditioning system component being flushed in order to build pressure inside the component, and
            then
            quickly
            release the blockage to pulse the flushing solvent out.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Safety
        <p>Do not use flammable fluids.</p>
        <p>Protect eyes with safety goggles.</p>
        <p>Wear chemical resistant gloves.</p>
        <p>Use approved fluids. CFCs R-11,113 or 115 and Methyl Chloroform also known as 1,1,1, Trichloroethane
            are
            not
            acceptable per the Clean Air Act.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Acceptable Flushing Fluids
        <p>Fluids designated for air conditioning flushing should be used and may be either solvent or lubricant
            based. Fluids
            used to flush the system should meet SAE specification J2670 to insure compatibility with refrigerant,
            oil and any
            materials used in the air conditioning system.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Components to Flush
        <p>Flush hoses, hard lines and heat exchangers. DO NOT flush the compressor, accumulator or receiver
            drier,
            refrigerant
            lines with mufflers, thermal expansion valve or orifice tube because residual flushing fluid cannot
            be
            removed from
            these components and they restrict the flow of flushing agent through other components.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Why Suction Side Flushing Is Important
        <p>When the off-cycle pressure equalizes in the backwards direction through damaged compressor valves,
            debris may be
            forced back up the suction hose. If it is not removed, this debris will travel into the replacement
            compressor and
            be circulated throughout the air conditioning system, causing subsequent failures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Flushing Rear Evaporator Lines
        <p>Debris is distributed throughout the entire air conditioning system so it is important to flush the
            rear
            lines. The
            rear expansion valve can be gutted or drilled out and remounted so that the rear evaporator and
            hoses
            can be back
            flushed as an assembly. After blowing out the flushing fluid and fumes a new thermal expansion valve
            should be
            mounted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Importance Of Flushing Direction
        <p>“Back flush”, or flushing in the reverse direction to normal flow, is the most effective. The plate
            fin
            evaporators
            used on many front and rear evaporators have many small passages which are difficult to clean
            without a
            strong
            pulsating reverse flow.</p>
    </li>
    <li>How long do I flush?
        <p>Closed loop procedure, flush until the flushing fluid leaving the air conditioning components are
            clean.
            Manual
            pressurized gun method requires a minimum of three times, but more if exiting fluid is not clean.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Removal of Residual Flushing Fluid before Evacuation and Charge
        <p>The primary vacuum pump should be protected from flushing fluid and fumes. Purging of flushing
            solvent is
            necessary
            before connecting the recovery recycle machine to evacuate and charge the air conditioning system.
            The
            best method
            is to allow Nitrogen to flow through the components. If Nitrogen is not available, clean and dried
            compressed air
            can be blown through the flushed components until the flush liquid is evaporated.</p>
