<p>The need for main wheel alignment is indicated by a number of subjective observations. The first probable sign of the need for alignment is excessive tire wear or feathering at the edges of the tread beads. Dog-tracking, or the tendency of the airplane to crab during taxi and roll out after landing, is another sign that alignment may be required. A visual observation of both of the wheels for symmetry of angle with respect to the airplane center-line when viewed from the front may show the need for alignment. </p>

<p>Manufacturing differences in forming of the main gear legs calls for the use of tapered shims to provide the correct camber and toe-in on the main wheels. No caster adjustment is available. A diagram of the chamber and toe-in measurements is shown in Figure 75. </p>

<p>The following procedure should be followed to align the main wheels: </p>

<ol type=‘1’>
    <li>The aircraft is to be fueled, but with empty hopper. Taxi the aircraft a short distance in a straight line to allow the gear legs to assume the natural position. The aircraft should be on paved surface or flat smooth ground.</li>
    <li>A long straight edge is placed across the front of the tires approximately at axle height. This straight edge is supported by blocks, or cans, or both. A 24-inch or larger carpenter square is placed against the straight edge and the outside surface of the tire, and held level with the ground at the axle height.  The tire should be square with the straight edge, or have up to 1/16-inch toe-in, measured at the center-line of the thread of the tire.</li>
    <li>Camber is then measured by placing a protractor on the vertical axis of the wheel through the axle.  Camber should measure 1° to 2°</li>
    <li>Should the wheel fail to check within these limits, the axle bolts are removed and the tapered shims rotated, deleted, or added to until the wheels check with these limits. With the aircraft hoisted and the wheels barely touching the ground, toe-in should measure 1/4-inch to 3/8-inch and camber should measure 2-1/4-inches.</li>
</ol>
