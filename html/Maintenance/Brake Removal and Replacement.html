<p>Brake fluid used is red Mil-H-5606A petroleum-base fluid, which is used in most light aircraft. Do not use automotive brake fluid as this will swell the O-rings. </p>

<p>The wheel units can be removed by using a wrench to remove the twelve bolts attaching the two halves of each brake assembly. The brake line may be left connected if only the linings are to be charged. Linings are Cleveland p/n 66-131 and are attached with Cleveland p/n 105-67 rivets. There are 32 linings and 64 rivets per aircraft.</p>

<p>Each brake assembly has four pistons, which are Cleveland p/n 062-09301. The O-ring installed in the cylinder is a Cleveland p/n 101-05200. </p>

<p>To remove the pistons in order to change O-rings, remove the brake line and install a 1/4X28 bolt in the piston. Pull the piston from the caliper housing. The pistons are aluminum and should be checked for wear, or burrs that could cut the O-ring. Check the bore in the housing at the same time. When installing new O-rings, soak them in MIL-H-5606 brake fluid before replacing time. Re-install the pistons with care, so that the O-ring is not damaged. </p>
