<p>Details of the main-gear spring are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_72.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. The main gear spring is p/n 40091-3. It will fit on either side of the aircraft. It is machined of E-4340 aircraft quality steel, formed, heat-treated, and shot-peened for fatigue resistance. It is sandblasted and primed with an epoxy primer (US Paint R9006 Epoxy Primer) and finished with Alumigrip G-9046 yellow polyurethane paint. </p>

<p>The gear spring is clamped to the fuselage frame with a p/n40145-1 clamp block with one NAS156A130 bolt and one NAS154DH59 bolt. MS20002C14 washers go under the aft bolt head and MS20002C16 washers go under the forward bolt head (Make sure the chamfered side of the washer is under the bolt head). Various numbers of 3088A325 round shim washers go between the clamp block and fuselage frame at the aft bolt location. The fwd bolt uses p/n3088A326 shims. The shims are selected to allow the bolts to be fully torqued without bending the clamp block. The 3088A shims are .010 thick. If too many thick shims are used the gear connection will be too loose and will rattle during taxi or landing. If the gear leg becomes loose during service even though the clamp block bolts are at full torque it is necessary to re-shim the clamp block. </p>

<p>The inboard attachment of the spring to the fuselage frame is with a NAS158A106 bolt, MS20002C18 washer under the bolt head (be sure the chamfered side of the washer is next to the head), one or more MS20002-18 washers under the nut, AN310-18 nut, and MS24665-360 cotter. The bolt is installed upside down and torque should be 7,000 inch-pounds (torque wrench on bolt head).  If after torquing, you are unable to install cotter, tighten until the next castellation aligns, not to exceed an additional 60Â°</p>

<p>It is necessary to hoist the aircraft as described under <xref sectionTarget="2.0.4" prependLabel="Section"></xref> when changing the inboard bolt. Be sure to grease the bolt with general purpose grease before installing. Also, be sure the bolt is marked R on the head to indicate the threads were rolled after heat-treat. </p>




<p>The method employed at the factory to determine the amount of shims required is to install the clamp block and fully torque the bolts before installing the large inboard bolt. The block is checked for straightness with a small straight edge (a six-inch steel scale is OK) to be sure the block is not bent by not having sufficient shims. Then the gear leg is grasped at the lower end, given an outboard tug by hand. A moderate tug should move the inboard end of the leg down from the attach bushing in the fuselage frame a distance 1/8" to 1/4". If it is a greater distance than 1/4" the connection is too loose, and a thinner shim is tried and the process repeated. Once the proper shims are determined, the bolts are loosened and the large inboard bolt is installed. Then the clamp block bolts are tightened to full torque (4,000 inch-pounds on aft bolt, 6,000 inch-pounds on fwd bolt). </p>


<p>Since each main gear leg is slightly different in thickness, and since each clamp block is machined within a specific tolerance, it is necessary to make a shim selection as described earlier, if either the gear leg or the clamp block is changed. </p>

<p>When ordering new main gear springs or clamp blocks also order 4 ea. 3088A325 and 4 ea. 3088A326 shims in case they are needed. In addition, the large aluminum tapered shims at the axle attachment might need an addition or change so it would be a good idea to order 2 ea. 4040141-3 shims and 2 ea 40114-2 shims in case they are needed. Whenever the airplane is ground-looped or involved in an incident that puts a permanent bend in one gear spring, the other spring must be changed as it may have been overstressed. </p>


<p>When the main gear springs are changed, use new bolts and nuts at all locations.  Install the springs to the fuselage in accordance with the instructions in this section, and install the axles to the spring using the procedure to check camber and toe-in outlined in <xref sectionTarget="2.90.3" prependLabel="Section"></xref>

</p> Be sure to make log book entries when bolts or gear springs are changed. </p>


<p>For more information on main landing gear installation, see Service Letter 151 for very detailed description of the removal, installation and alignment of the main gear spring and wheels.</p>

<p><b>Obstruction Collision</b></p>
<p>If an obstruction is hit with the main gear, change the forward clamp bolt immediately and check the clamp block for straightness per <xref sectionTarget="2.90.50" prependLabel="Section"></xref>. The forward clamp bolt can be changed without hoisting the aircraft. The parking brake should be set, and use care so as not to disturb the shims that are in place. </p>
