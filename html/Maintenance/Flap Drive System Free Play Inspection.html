<p>This inspection procedure was originally recommended in SL338. It is provided here for convenience</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Remove the left side fuselage side skin below the cockpit door to gain access to the flap actuator
    </li>
    <li>
        Locate the flap actuator.
    </li>
    <li>
        Firmly apply a load to the trailing edge of the flap. Pay particular attention to “end play” in the flap system.
        Note: Some “flexing” of the flap system and connection points is normal.
    </li>
    <li>
        While applying static loads to the flap trailing edge, alternating between the extend and retract
        directions, inspect for fore - aft movement in the flap actuator jack screw shaft relative to the flap
        actuator drive gear housing. Movement in this area indicates that the retaining nut is no longer
        torqued properly or the parts are worn. Significant wear requires replacement of parts or the complete actuator and is defined as ½"
        or more of flap
        trailing edge movement with moderate hand pressure on the trailing edge.

        Notify Air Tractor, Inc. Customer Service department if any indication of fore - aft movement exists.
