<p class="dontBreakAfter"><b>Compressor Removal</b></p>
<p>To remove the compressor, these steps should be followed: </p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Remove all refrigerant from the system using a Freon Recovery Unit (FRU).</li>
    <li>Remove the hose fittings at the rear of the compressor by first removing the bolt and strap that hold the T-head
        clamp in place. The hose fittings can now be removed from the compressor's head without tools.</li>
    <li>Separate the wrist-lock connector in the wire that powers the clutch.</li>
    <li>Loosen the nuts on the two AN5 pivot bolts that secure the compressor to the drive-shaft housing.</li>
    <li>Remove safety wire and loosen the belt-tension turnbuckle and remove belts.</li>
    <li>Remove the bolt that connects the belt-adjustment turnbuckle to the compressor case.</li>
    <li>Support the compressor and remove the AN5 bolts and nuts that secure the compressor to the drive-shaft housing.
        This
        also releases the turnbuckle that serves as a side brace.</li>
    <li>Gently lift the compressor from the engine compartment.</li>
</ol>

<p class="dontBreakAfter"><b>Compressor Replacement</b></p>
<p>It's critical for successful compressor replacement that the new compressor is installed in a clean system with a
    correct oil charge. Contamination remaining in the system will be pulled into the new compressor and lodge under the
    valves and in bearings causing quick failure of the new compressor. Also it's important to maintain the original oil
    charge amount when replacing the compressor. </p>

<p>Use refrigeration oil on the O-rings at the compressor-hose fitting before reconnecting to compressor.
    Follow evacuation and refrigerant charging instructions spelled out in this section of this manual. </p>

<p>
    To replace the compressor, the removal steps should be followed in the reverse order. For R134a systems, tension the
    belt per
