<p>Details of the fuselage removable skins are shown in Figure 57. </p>

<p>The side skins of the fuselage are attached to the fixed skins with 1/4 turn studs of various lengths. The stud has a basic part number of 4002 (Camloc) or 1142005 (Monadnock) and the dash number designates the length. The most common stud is 4002-3 with the next most common a 4002-4. All studs have the dash numbers on the head. Stud lengths used are -3 through -15. Stud installation requires a 4002-N grommet and a R4G snap ring. Installation pliers are needed for stud installation or removal. All Camloc receptacles are p/n 40R17-2. </p>

<p>The side skins can be easily removed. </p>

<p>The side skins have a thin strip of cork to prevent chafing. This cork is 1/16" thick by 1 1/8" wide, comes in 10 ft. rolls, has pressure sensitive adhesive backing and is p/n 1/16x1 1/8 CORK. A punch is made of a piece of 3/4" OD tubing and one end sharpened on a grinder. At each 1/4 turn fastener position, the cork is marked and a 3/4" hole is punched. </p>

<p>The side skins are sheared to size, but the 1/4 turn fastener holes will require drilling on installation. The old skin may be used for a pattern, or if it is damaged, ask the factory to provide a hole finder. Use a .471 diameter hole saw to drill the side skins to match the receptacles. These hole saws have a No. 30 pilot. </p>
