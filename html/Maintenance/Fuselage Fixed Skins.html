<p>The fixed skins are attached with 8-32 machine screws and nuts. Nuts in the lower skins are stainless MS21044-C08 and in the upper fuselage areas are AN365-832. The 100° countersunk machine screws are p/n 90012-5 for the 8-32 x 1/2 size, 90012-7 for the 8-32x5/8 size. The Truss head machine screws are p/n 90013-3 for the 8-32x3/8 long, -5 for 1/2 long,-7 for 5/8 long, and -8 for the ¾ long. </p>

<p>The long lower skin halves are attached to the skin under the cockpit floor with rivets, but if it is desired to remove one skin but not the other, the rivets can be drilled out and replaced with 90013-3 or -5 screws and stainless nuts. If the baggage floor is to be removed, it is necessary to remove the long lower skin halves, in order to reach the nuts. </p>

<p>During 12-month inspections, all screws attaching the fixed skins should be checked to see if they are tight. </p>

<p>The Camloc receptacles are attached to all lower skins and stringers before these parts are attached to the aircraft. If a skin or stringer is replaced, be sure to install the side skin and attach it to the part being replaced so that it will be properly positioned for the side skins to fit after installation to the airframe. </p>
