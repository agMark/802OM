<p>The flaps are attached to the 1/2" thick aluminum mid and inboard flap arms with AN4-12A bolts and to the outboard arm with an AN4-24A bolt. The order of washers and parts with the bolt pointing inboard is a AN970-4 large washer under the bolt head, then the bearing (Fafnir KP4), then the steel flap arm, then a AN960-416 washer, then a AN365-428A nut. </p>

<p>The flap push-rod is attached to the flap with an AN4-12A bolt, which is pointing outboard, and the order of parts is AN960-416 washer under the nut. The push-rod has an adjustable Fafnir RE4F6-2 bearing with an AN316-6 check nut. Be sure that the bearing is positioned to allow the push-rod to be rotated slightly from side to side. </p>

<p>During 12-month inspections, the AN4-12A bolt through the push-rod should be checked for straightness, and if bent, both the bolt and bearing should be replaced immediately. At 100 hour intervals, remove the lower fuselage side skins under the cockpit and while the flaps are being cycled through the full range of travel, check to see if the push-rods drag on any fuselage parts. With the flaps full down, and then full up, move the ailerons through the full range of travel and check clearance.</p>

<p>Details showing flap removal and installation are shown in <span style="color:red">Figure 25</span>. The procedures for these operations are shown below </p>
