<p>
    Corrosion is common problem for Air Tractor aircraft due to the environments in which they are operated.
    Inspecting for, and removing / fixing corrosion issues as soon as possible will likely save significant 
    repair costs in the future.  The entire aircraft should be inspected for corrosion regularly, in particular, the following procedure should be performed every 12 months (at a minimum).

<p>
    Inspecting for corrosion is important for all aircraft, not just agricultural aircraft.  Firefighting aircraft have experienced significant corrosion issues, especially when operated in a salt water environment.

</ol>

<p>
    For the above cases and other corrosion occurrences, follow the inspection and corrosion removal guidelines found in FAA Advisory Circular 43.13-1B chapter 6. In some instances, it may be possible to remove minor corrosion in the field. If corrosion is found, please contact your dealer who will communicate your information to the Air Tractor service department.
