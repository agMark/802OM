<b>General</b>

<p>Each of the separate electrical circuits discussed in this section is accompanied by its particular wiring schematic drawing shown as a figure in Section 7. The associated Air Tractor part number of a component is the drawing number plus -1 or -2 for left-hand and right-hand parts, respectively. In the event that the part is symmetrical, without a hand designation, the suffix number is -1. </p>

<p>All troubleshooting of electrical systems is directed toward the identification of faulty components. The most valuable tool for use in troubleshooting is the Volt/Ohmmeter. </p>

<p>The Voltmeter is used with electrical power ON for the circuit under examination. It is used to determine that the proper voltage is available at the appliance or at any location in the circuit between the airplane bus and the appliance. A socketed 28-Volt bulb may be substituted for the Voltmeter, with one wire lead connected to a wire or terminal while the other wire lead is connected to ground. </p>

<p>The Ohmmeter must be used with electrical power OFF of the circuit under examination. It is primarily useful for establishing the continuity of wiring or ground contacts. Here, the resistance of the wiring and gound circuits should read near ZERO Ohms. The Ohmmeter is of little value in evaluating appliances such as motors, lamps, etc., since the desirable resistance of the appliance is unknown. The exception is when the resistance is very high (infinite), indicating an open circuit and a failed component. </p>

<p>The simplest means of ascertaining a faulty component is substitution with a known functioning component. This is practical if the substituted part is a switch or light bulb, or easily available part. </p>
