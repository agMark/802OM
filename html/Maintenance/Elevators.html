<p>The elevators are attached to the stabilizers and to the pedestal in the fuselage with AN4-10A bolts, with an AN960-416 washer under the bolt head and two washers under the AN365-428A nut, except at the pedestal where only one washer is under the nut. The elevator horns connect to the aft push-rod with an AN4-10A bolt, two AN960-416 washers (placed to give maximum fuselage clearance), and an AN365-428A nut. </p>

<p>Like the rudder, the elevators and center pedestal have NMB p/n MS14104-4 spherical bearings installed, and due to bearing drag, it is very important for all bolts connecting the elevators and the horns to be fully torqued (100 inch-pounds at the nut). We have seen elevator horns with badly elongated holes because the elevators had been replaced in the field and the bolts were not fully torqued. </p>

<p>To replace the bearings, see the section on RUDDER for instructions. </p>

<p>Elevator stops are at the elevator horn. The down stop has a p/n 70067-1 neoprene washer in compression to absorb shocks. Sometimes this washer splits and falls out so during 100 hour inspections, check to see if this washer is in place. Also, if the control stick is pulled back sharply against the up stop or if a wind gust blows the elevator up, the up stop bracket may bend and should be straightened if found to be bent. </p>

<p>Check the elevator and make sure that it is within the limits specified in the Type Certificate Data Sheet. </p>
