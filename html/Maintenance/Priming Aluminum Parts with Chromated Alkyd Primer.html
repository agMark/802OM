<p>Parts that do not receive a finish coat of paint (such as wing ribs) are primed with Chromated Alkyd Primer conforming to spec TT-P-1757B, Type I, Class C.  Surfaces must be clean and free of grease, dirt, oil, rust, fingerprints, and other contaminants to insure optimum adhesion and performance properties.  Parts may be cleaned using an alcohol-soaked soft rag.  Follow the Acid Etch and Alodine process described in the “Stripping and Re-painting Aluminum Parts” section above.  Apply a light coat of Chromated Alkyd Primer thinned with Toluene R2K1 or Xylene R2K4 if necessary to achieve proper viscosity.  Spray coatings with smooth, even strokes.  Runs and sags are to be avoided.  The primer application should be a thin film. </p>
