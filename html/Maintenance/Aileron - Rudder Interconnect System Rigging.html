<b><u>Rigging Instructions:</u></b>

<p>Complete these instructions on both sides of the aircraft simultaneously.</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Lock the flight control stick in the neutral position using the cockpit control lock. Confirm the ailerons are
        in the neutral position</li>

    <li>Check the position of the clamp that supports the two idler arms. This clamp should be 10.0 (+/-Â½) inches from
        the interface of the longeron and diagonal tube. See <xref fileTarget="img_AileronRudderInterconnectArms.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. If necessary, loosen the clamp, adjust it within
        this range, and re-tighten hardware.</li>

    <li>Check the position of each centering spring. Ensue that the Adel clamp anchoring each spring is located at a
        position of 8-3/4 (+/- 1/16) inches from the center of the clamp. See <xref fileTarget="img_AileronRudderInterconnectArms.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. Adjust the position of the Adel
        clamps if necessary. </li>

    <li>Ensure that the lower centering spring is connected to the inboard idler arm and the upper centering spring is
        connected to the outboard idler arm. </li>

    <li>Ensure that the 70814-4 interconnect spring is connected to the top hole of the outboard idler arm. </li>

    <li>Ensure that the 70525 interconnect cable is connected to the inboard idler arm. The position of this cable
        attachment varies with the serial number of the aircraft. See <xref fileTarget="img_AileronRudderInterconnectArms.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>.

        <p>For serial Numbers -0001 thru -0073, -0075, and -0076: the cable should attach to the top hole in the inboard
            idler arm (approx. 3/8 from the end).</p>

        For Serial Numbers -0074, and -0077 & subsequent: the cable should attach to the second hole in the inboard
        idler arm (approx. 1 3/8 from the end).

    </li>

    <li>Manually center the rudder and hold in place. </li>

    <li>Visually ensure that the rudder pedals are even in the cockpit. Adjust if needed. </li>

    <li>Measure the horizontal spread of the idler arms as shown below. This dimension should measure between
        1-3/4 and 1-7/8 inches. In addition, both sides must match within 1/16 inches.

        </figure>
    </li>

    <li>If necessary to match the dimension stated in Step 9, adjust the turnbuckles on the cables shown below. After
        adjusting, safety the turnbuckles with MS20995C32 wire (Reference: FAA Advisory Circular 43.13-1B).

        </figure>
    </li>

    <li>Check the cable routing for pulleys that are out of alignment and for cable contact with any structure. Check
        the cables for any damage or wear that would necessitate replacement (Reference: FAA Advisory Circular
        43.13-1B). </li>

    <li>Ensure that all hardware is tight and properly installed. </li>

    <li>Unlock the controls and move the rudder pedals and aileron controls through their full range of motion. Check
        for any binding or sticking of controls. Applying full right-hand rudder input should result in a tendency for
        the right-hand aileron to rise and applying full left-hand rudder input should result in a tendency for the
        left-hand aileron to rise. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you operate an aircraft in the serial number -0001 through -0020 range, there has been a previous incident where one balance cable in the aileron control system became loose. The cable rode over the rim of a pulley and caused a drag force in the control stick. The aircraft remained controllable and was returned to the landing strip without further incident. A change in the design was made to prevent this from happening on serial number -0021 and subsequent.</p>

<p>The aileron rudder interconnect system has been changed to incorporate a spring in each cable where it attaches to the control stick torque horn. This spring helps keep the interconnect cable tight. Consult Service Letter #150 if you need to update your aircraft with this improvement.</p>

<p>Air Tractor has received a report of an in-flight jamming of a rudder pedal. The pilot was able to maintain control and, after landing, a cable pulley in the rudder system was found to be broken. Due to the numerous unsecured items in the baggage compartment, it is believed that one or more items fouled the cables causing the cables to jam resulting in a subsequent failure of the pulley. 
</p>
<p>Shield installations have been developed for serial numbers -0001 through -0319 to prevent this from happening. To prevent possible baggage interference with the flight controls, we encourage the installation of these shields per the directions located in Service Letter #274.</p>
