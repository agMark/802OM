<b>Ailerons</b>

<p>The ailerons are all-metal and require very little maintenance. The lead counterweight will sometimes loosen on the long AN3-35A bolt through the lead and the support tube. If the counterweight is loose, remove the counterweight and support tube and drill and ream them for a larger bolt. To do this, remove the aileron from the aircraft by removing the nuts from the three hinge fittings, removing the four screws in the inspection plate where the push-rod attaches to the wing bellcrank, and removing the nut from the bolt through the bellcrank and push-rod. Note that there is a spacer washer between the aluminum hinge and the support arm bearing, and that there is an AN970-4 large washer on the outboard side of the bearing under the bolt head. </p>

<p>With the AN4-12A bolts pointing inboard, the correct order of parts would be a AN970-4 washer under the bolt head, then a AN960-416L washer, then the bearing, then a AN960-416 washer, then the aluminum aileron hinge, then a AN960-416 washer, then a AN365-428 nut. The steel inboard hinge uses an AN4-25A bolt, with an AN960-416 washer under the head, then an AN970-4 washer, then the bearing, then the steel hinge, then an AN960-416 washer, then an AN365-428 nut. Leave the push-rod attached to the aileron and reach through the inspection plate opening and remove the bolt attaching the push-rod to the wing bellcrank. Be sure to have someone holding up on the aileron trailing edge, and the control stick lock should be in place. Then remove the center hinge bolt, with someone at each end of the aileron, remove the two outboard bolts, lift up on the push-rod to keep it from dragging, and remove the aileron from the aircraft. A diagram showing procedure to remove and install the aileron is shown in Figure 24.</p>

<p>The counterweight support tube in p/n 20279-2 and can be removed from the aileron by removing the two plug buttons on the upper and lower side of the aileron nose skin and removing the AN3-12A bolt that attaches the support tube to the support structure that is riveted to the aileron. The counterweight and support tube can then be taken to the workbench where the long AN3-35A bolt is removed. Leaving the parts together, clamp the counterweight to the base of the drill-press, using a long 3/16 “ drill bit chucked in the drill press align the spindle with the 3/16 hole through the counterweight and support tube. Then change to a 7/32” drill bit and enlarge the hole. Then ream .248 through both parts. Grease the new AN4-35A bolt and install. </p>

<p>Re-install the counterweight and support tube on the aileron and check for a snug fit. When installing the counterweight on the aileron use PR1422A2 to bond the weight to the aileron in addition to the AN4-35A bolt. The AN3 bolts have a torque of 100 inch-pounds applied at the head. Re-install the aileron in the reverse order as removed, taking care that the washer arrangement is correct. The bolt through the push rod and wing bellcrank is an AN4-12A with an AN960-416 washer under the head and one under the AN365-428A nut.</p>

<p>While the aileron is removed, check the aluminum hinges for secure attachment to the spar, and check the steel hinge for signs of corrosion, or loose rivets, or cracks in the welded areas. Inspect both ends of the push-rods for cracks in the threads, check the rod-end bearing (Fafnir RE4F6-2) for condition and lubrication, and be sure the check nut against the bearing is snug. </p>

<p>After the aileron has been re-installed an inspection of all connections has been made, reach through the inspection plate opening and check to see if the push-rod is free to rotate slightly as the aileron is moved through the full range of travel. After being sure the bolt through the push-rod and wing bellcrank has been torqued, re-install the inspection plate with the four screws.</p>

<p>The bearings in the aileron support arms are Fafnir KP4 and make a press-fit into the 3/8” thick aluminum arm. These are staked on both sides. These bearings are sealed, require no lubrication, and rarely require replacement in service.</p>
