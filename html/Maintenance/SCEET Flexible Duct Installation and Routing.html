<p>Flexible wire supported ducting comes in several types, CAT/SCAT/CEET/SCEET. Care is needed when installing the CEET or SCEET ducting since these have both an external cover and an internal lining. Ensure that both the hose cover and the internal lining are fitted onto the flange and that both are captured under the hose clamp. If the internal lining is not properly captured, it can potentially become dislodged inside the duct, which can cause an obstruction within the duct. </p>

<p>While care should be exercised for all SCEET installations, the engine compressor BOV discharge duct is an area where extra focus is warranted. An obstruction within this duct can result in erratic engine operation.</p>

<p>There has also been a report of a hose in the cockpit heater system developing a leak and causing engine power loss. The bleed air loss through the hose which connects to the bleed air port was being ingested into the engine and preventing the engine from developing full power. </p>

<p>Be aware of this bleed air routing when troubleshooting any engine power loss concerns. The hose assembly connects to the bleed air line coming off the engine and is contained within the engine air intake plenum and is normally hidden from view even with the side skins removed. Removal of the engine plenum cover is required to inspect this hose.</p>
