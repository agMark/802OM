<p>The wiring schematic for the wing flaps is shown in Figure 28. The horn is connected in series with the lift-detector switch that is located near the leading edge of a mid-span of the right-hand wing. </p>

<p>The lift-detector switch is controlled by a tap that projects forward into the airstream. When at rest, the weight of the tab holds it down, opening the switch. When the airflow around the lift detector shifts to a forward direction, that tab is lifted, closing the switch and causing the horn to sound. </p>
