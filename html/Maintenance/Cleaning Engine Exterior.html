<p>The cleaning of your engine may be accomplished only when the engine is cold. NEVER WASH A HOT ENGINE. You may wash the engine exterior with water or with a petroleum base solvent. While cleaning your engine, it is a good time to inspect all the engine externals; tubing, wiring, control linkages, hose assemblies, etc. You should look for evidence of wear, chafing, cracks, corrosion, fuel and oil leaks, and the security of hoses, brackets, clamps and connections. Also inspect your air inlet system for signs of leaks that would allow unfiltered air into the engine. </p>

<p>After cleaning your engine, blow it off with compressed air and run the engine until it is dry. Keeping the outside of your engine clean will help in spotting problems, make controls easier to operate, and limit the wear on the beta block and beta ring. Remember also to keep your oil cooler cleaned on a regular basis to maintain the efficiency of the cooler for operation in hot weather. </p>
