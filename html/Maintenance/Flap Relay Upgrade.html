<p>Several types of flap relays have been used on AT-802 aircraft.</p>
<p>If you have not already or the airplane was not equipped with them since new, Air Tractor highly recommends that you replace older flap relays with the Kissling relays currently used in new production.  See SL184 for instructions.</p>
