<p> <b><u>Initial Rigging Instructions: </u></b></p>

<p>The initial rigging of the Aileron Boost Tabs is performed as follows:</p>
<ol type='1'>
    <li>Lock the flight control stick in the neutral position using the cockpit control lock. Confirm that the ailerons
        are in the neutral position and rigged in accordance with 
        <xref sectionTarget="2.30.1" prependLabel="Section"></xref>
        .</li>

    <li>Using a straight edged tool approximately 6 inches in length, check that the lower surface of the boost tab is
        in line with the lower surface of the aileron. Make this check within 4 inches of the boost tab control horn.
    </li>

    <li>If necessary, adjust the pushrod length to align boost tab per step 2. Ensure that the pushrod threads are
        visible in the “witness holes" on the rod end bearings and that the check nuts are tight against the bearings.
    </li>

    <li>Ensure that all hardware is tight and properly installed. </li>

    <li>Repeat for both sides of the aircraft. </li>
</ol>

<b><u>Additional Adjustments:</u></b>

<p>The aileron boost tabs can be adjusted to tailor the roll handling of the aircraft. The total adjustment for each
    boost tab is limited to one full turn of any rod end bearing from the initial rigged position. </p>

<p>With the boost tabs set to their initial rigging positions as described above, perform a test flight of the aircraft
    with the electric aileron trim in the neutral position. Note any rolling tendencies and adjust the fixed aluminum
    trim tab on the right aileron to correct the rolling tendencies: bending the tab up will raise the right wing and
    bending the tab down will drop the right wing.</p>

<p>Repeat the test flight and trim tab bending as necessary to allow the aircraft to fly straight and level. The
    electric aileron trim can be used for small trim corrections. </p>

<p>If adjustment of the bendable aileron trim tab is not sufficient to trim the aircraft for level flight, then the
    boost tabs may be used for additional trimming. One tab may be deflected upward and the other downward by identical
    amounts. Adjusting the trailing edge of the tab upwards will cause that wing to rise. </p>

<p>Additionally, adjusting both tabs upward or downward together will affect the amount of stick force the pilot
    experiences in roll. Adjusting the trailing edge of both tabs upward (lengthening the pushrod) will increase the
    stick force required and will make the airplane stable in roll. Adjusting the trailing edge of both tabs downward
    (shortening the pushrod) will decrease the stick force required and will make the airplane less stable in roll.</p>

    <p class='boxWarningLargeHeader'>WARNING</p>

    <p class='boxWarningLargeText'>These adjustments should be made with much care. Small changes in the rigging of the
        aileron boost tabs can have significant effects on the handling qualities of the aircraft. Incorrect adjustments
        of the tabs could lead to aircraft loss of control and an accident. Adjustments should be made in increments of
        1/2 turn per boost tab, with test flights conducted in between, until flying qualities are acceptable within
        safe limits.

        Reducing the aileron control stick forces will reduce the roll stability of the aircraft. This should only be
        done if the control forces are objectionable and require adjustments.

<b><u>Final Check:</u></b>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Ensure that the total adjustment for each boost tab has not exceeded one full turn of any rod end bearing from
        the initial rigged position. If additional adjustment is required, contact the Air Tractor factory for
        assistance. </li>

    <li>Ensure that the pushrod threads are visible in the “witness hole" on each rod-end bearing, that each check nut is
        tight against the bearings, and that all hardware is tight and properly installed.</li>
