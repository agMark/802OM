<p>The main wing walk is made of 3-M safety walk 12‚Äù wide and is p/n 20232-2. The small round walk part is p/n20234-1 and the flap walk is p/n 20427-1. The walk outboard of the main walk is p/n 20565-2. The trim plate on the forward edge of the walk is p/n 20231-1 and p/n 20718-1 is on the aft edge. </p>

<p>The walk material has adhesive backing but in order to improve the bond to the wing skin, 3-M safety Walk Adhesive is applied to the wing surface. To prevent fuel from getting under the walk and lifting it, 3-M Edge Sealing Compound is applied along the perimeter of the walk. If the walk is changed, be sure to order the adhesive and the edge sealing compound for best results. </p>
