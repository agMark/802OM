<p>The main wing walk is made of 3-M safety walk 12" wide and is p/n 20232-2. The small round walk part is p/n20234-1 and the flap walk is p/n 20427-1. The walk outboard of the main walk is p/n 20565-2. The trim plate on the forward edge of the walk is p/n 20231-1 and p/n 20718-1 is on the aft edge. </p>

<p>The walk material has adhesive backing but in order to improve the bond to the wing skin, 3-M safety Walk Adhesive is applied to the wing surface. To prevent fuel from getting under the walk and lifting it, 3-M Edge Sealing Compound is applied along the perimeter of the walk. If the walk is changed, be sure to order the adhesive and the edge sealing compound for best results. </p>

<p>To help prevent falls, inspect the wing walk anti skid material often for wear, peeling up, general condition and security. Wing walk material that is loose, torn, blistered, peeling or otherwise damaged should be repaired or replaced. It is best to use the original 3M material supplied by the factory. Randolf wing walk compound is an acceptable alternate to the 3M material but does not have as good of anti-slip characteristics as the 3M material.
