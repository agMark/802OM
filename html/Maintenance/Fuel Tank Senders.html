    Each of the fuel tanks has two fuel-quantity sending elements. These two sending elements are connected in series
    electrically. The outboard sending element is active in sensing fuel level when the fuel level is in the upper third
    of the tank. The inboard sending element is active when the fuel level is in the lower third of the tank. Both of
    the elements are active when the fuel level is in the mid-range. A functional schematic is shown in 
    <xref fileTarget="img_AnalogFuelQuantitySchematic.png"></xref>.

<p>The inboard sender is insulated from ground (wing skin) by insulating washers that are used on both sides of the five
    holes in its flange.</p>

<p>The outboard sender is grounded to the wing skin through its mounting bolts.</p>

<p>The inboard tank sender is p/n 20680-1 and the outboard sender is p/n 20875-1. Both use the Rochester C7740-43
    resistive float probe. The sender is attached with five AN3-32A bolts, 20194-3 bushings, and AN365-1032 nuts. Both
    senders have p/n 20173-1 Teflon washers under the bolt head for sealing purposes. </p>

<p><b>Troubleshooting</b></p>
<p>To verify functionality of the senders:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Remove fuel tank covers as required to gain access to senders.</li>
    <li>Locate wiring exiting wing. This will be either a "banana jack" or a COAX connector.</li>
    <li>Each sender should provide between 0 and 30 ohms of resistance. There are multiple ways to verify that each is
        functioning, the following assumes the tank has been drained and the senders are resting at the bottom of the
        tank.</li>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Measure resistance between signal wire (banana jack or center coax center conductor). Resistance should be
            very near 0 ohms with both probes fully down.</li>
        <li>Slowly raise 1 probe. Resistance will increase to approximately 30 ohms. Observe for erratic behavior any
            signs of
            a bad resistor wiper.</li>
        <li>With first probe all the way down, slowly exercise the other probe in the same way.</li>
        <li>Raise both probes, total resistance should be approximately 60 ohms.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If this procedure did not identify the cause of the issue, inspect for damaged wires or insulators on the
        inboard sender. Inadvertent grounding is a typical cause of issues.
    </li>
</ol>


<p>To verify sender excitation from analog fuel gauges:</p>
<p>Excitation voltage is provided by the gauges. A small circuit board uses a Zener diode circuit to provide a small
    voltage that runs through the senders.</p>
<p>With infinite resistance (unplug the coax cable or banana jack), the voltage entering the wing should be
    approximately 0.5V. If otherwise, further inspect the gauge and trimming circuit.</p>


<p><b>Sender Replacement</b></p>

<p>When the sender is being replaced, the cork at the end of the float arm should just touch the bottom of the tank when
    the arm is at the lower end of its stroke. It should almost touch the top of the tank at the upper end of the
    stroke. If it will not quite touch the tank bottom or touches too soon, bend the arm gently by hand to achieve the
    desired position. </p>

<p>
    Before re-installing the inspection plate on the fuel tank top, move the float arm through the full stroke with the
    battery switch â€œOn" to see that the sender is working properly. Seal the inspection plate per instruction in 
    <xref sectionTarget="2.75.2" prependLabel="Section"></xref> and re-install.
