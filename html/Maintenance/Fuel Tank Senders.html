<p>Each of the fuel tanks has two fuel-quantity sending elements. These two sending elements are connected in series electrically. The outboard sending element is active in sensing fuel level when the fuel level is in the upper third of the tank. The inboard sending element is active when the fuel level is in the lower third of the tank. Both of the elements are active when the fuel level is in the mid-range. The schematic for the fuel gauge system is shown in Figure 28. </p>

<p>The inboard sender is insulated from ground by the ten insulating washers that are used on both sides of the five holes in its flange. It has two wires attached. One of the wires exits the fuel-tank wall through a banana jack en route to the outboard sender. The other wire exits the fuel-tank inboard end wall through a banana jack en route to the fuel gauge. </p>

<p>The outboard sender is grounded through its mounting bolts. The wire attached to its center post connects it, through the banana jack, to the inboard sender. </p>

<p>The inboard tank sender is p/n 20680-1 and the outboard sender is p/nC7740-43. The sender is attached with five AN3-32A bolts, 20194-3 bushings, and AN365-1032 nuts. Both senders have p/n 20173-1 Teflon washers under the bolt head for sealing purposes.  If a sender is not working properly, the procedure is to remove the inspection cover from the fuel tank top just forward of the five sender attach bolts and before removing the sender, first push the banana plug firmly into the jack to be sure proper connection has previously been made. If this has no effect, pull out the banana plug and connect to an Ohmmeter with the other lead grounded to the flange of the sender. With the float arm all the way down, the Ohmmeter should read zero and the arm all the way up, the Ohmmeter should read 29-30 Ohms. Cycle the arm and the needle should not have an erratic movement. If all is OK, the sender does not have to be replaced. If there is still indication of a faulty sender, remove the five bolts attaching it to the tank top, being careful not to damage the Teflon washers under the head of each screw. The fuel tank should be drained before the sender is replaced. The five bushings will probably be held in place by the tank sealing compound if care is taken when removing the sender. Pull the banana plugs from the jacks and remove the sender. </p>

<p>When the sender is being replaced, the cork at the end of the float arm should just touch the bottom of the tank when the arm is at the lower end of its stroke. It should almost touch the top of the tank at the upper end of the stroke. If it will not quite touch the tank bottom or touches too soon, bend the arm gently by hand to achieve the desired position. </p>

<p>Before re-installing the inspection plate on the fuel tank top, move the float arm through the full stroke with the battery switch “On" to see that the sender is working properly. Seal the inspection plate per instruction in “Fuel Tank" and re-install. </p>
