<b>Brake Linings</b>

<p>There are eight pairs of the brake linings on each brake. Four of the pairs are on the front of the brake and four to the rear. The pairs are located on either side of the brake disc directly beneath each of the eight pistons. </p>

<p>The end pair of brake linings can be seen on the top and bottom ends of both sides of the brake disc while installed on the airplane. New brake linings are .250-inch thick. The brake linings should be replaced when the remaining thickness is less than .100-inch to prevent rivet damage to the brake disc. </p>
