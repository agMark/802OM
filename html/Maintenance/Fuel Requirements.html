<p>The Pratt & Whitney PT6A engine will run on Jet A, kerosene, diesel, or Avgas. Avgas may be used only in the case of an emergency and for duration of no longer than 150 hours between overhauls. Diesel is not recommended. Diesel does not burn as clean as Jet A or kerosene, causing problems with fuel nozzles, combustion liners, and hot section parts. </p>

<p>Air Tractor recommends the use of Jet A fuel that has been treated with a Fuel System Icing Inhibitor (FSII) such as Prist. Some Jet A comes from the supplier with FSII in it and some does not, so check with your supplier to be sure.  It is also recommended that fuel be treated with a Biocide (such as BioBor) to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungus in your fuel storage tank(s). </p>

<p>On your ground equipment, install a fuel filter/water separator that will shut off the fuel flow when water is present. Fuel MUST be kept clean, water free, and free of bacterial and fungal growth. Care should be taken when fueling the aircraft in dusty conditions to keep dirt form entering the fuel tanks. </p>
