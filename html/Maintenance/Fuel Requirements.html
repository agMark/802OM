<p>The Pratt & Whitney PT6A engine will run on a variety of fuels. Avgas may be used only in the case of an emergency and for duration of no longer than 150 hours between overhauls. Diesel is not recommended. Diesel does not burn as clean as Jet A or kerosene, causing problems with fuel nozzles, combustion liners, and hot section parts. </p>

<p>Check that the electric fuel boost pump is operating properly prior to starting the engine. Then, whenever there is any amount of Avgas being used, even when it is mixed with Jet A or another approved fuel, leave the electric fuel boost pump switched on for all flight operations. Doing this will ensure that the engine will receive fuel at the proper pressure and flow rate that it needs. Failure to do so could result in damage to the airframe engine-driven fuel pump, damage to the engine's FCU fuel pump, or result in loss of engine power. </p>

<p>Air Tractor recommends the use of Jet A fuel that has been treated with a Fuel System Icing Inhibitor (FSII) such as Prist. Some Jet A comes from the supplier with FSII in it and some does not, so check with your supplier to be sure.  It is also recommended that fuel be treated with a Biocide (such as BioBor) to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungus in your fuel storage tank(s).</p>

<p>On your ground equipment, install a fuel filter/water separator that will shut off the fuel flow when water is present. Fuel MUST be kept clean, water free, and free of bacterial and fungal growth. Care should be taken when fueling the aircraft in dusty conditions to keep dirt form entering the fuel tanks. </p>
