<p>The Aileron Idler under the cockpit floor is p/n 70510-1 and is interchangeable right to left. These bellcranks have
    Fafnir KP6A bearings installed with a 70081-2 stainless spacer that allows the AN43B-24A eyebolt that connect the
    bellcrank to the support frame assembly to be fully torqued (100 inch-pounds at the nut). </p>

<p>The KP6A bearings are sealed and require no lubrication. Some end play will develop due to tolerance accumulation,
    but up to .040" is acceptable. </p>

<p>The aileron bellcranks in the wings are attached to a welded structure with an AN4-46A bolt. These have a p/n 70081-3
    stainless spacer to allow full bolt torque. Bearings are Fafnir KP6A. The wing bellcranks are p/n 700511-1 (L/H) and
    70511-2 (R/H). Maximum end play of the wing bellcrank is .03". The bolt attaching the wing bellcranks may be reached
    by removing the plug buttons (11/16) on the top and bottom wing skins. To remove the bellcrank from the wing it is
    necessary to remove some rivets attaching the lower wing skin. Remove only rivets that can be easily reached with a
    bucking bar for re-installation. </p>

<p>The lower aileron torque tube beneath the cockpit floor is p/n 70509-1 (for s/n 802-0001 thru 802-0076 and 802A-0003
    thru 802A-0073) or p/n 71021-1 (for s/n 802-0077 and subs and 802A-0074 and subs) and is supported on each end by
    p/n 70721-1 housings, which contain the B1212 Torrington needle bearings. There is a grease fitting on each end of
    the torque tube to allow greasing the Torrington bearings with General Purpose grease. Pushrods from the lower
    torque tube to the Idlers are p/n 70554-1 and have Fafnir RE4F6-2 bearings that may be adjusted on each end. The two
    centering springs are p/n 40044-1.</p>

<p>The flap torque tube is attached to the fuselage frame with two AN4-10A bolts. The bearings, which are pressed into
    the torque tube fittings and staked, are NMB p/n MS14104-4. These are spherical bearings with a stainless ball and a
    Teflon lining. As this type of bearing has some drag, be sure the AN4-10A attach bolts are fully torqued to 100
    inch-pounds at the nut. These bearings do not require lubrication. The 2.5" diameter flap torque tube consists of
    the welded assembly and bearings only. At the extreme end of each side of the torque tube is a 3/8" thick aluminum
    arm (p/n 70027-4), which also has a NMB p/n MS14104-4 bearing installed. The two flap push-rods attach to the
    bearings with AN4-11A bolts and should be torqued to 100 inch-pounds at the nut. </p>
