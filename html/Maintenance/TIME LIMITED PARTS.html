<p>To determine the life limits for airplane parts, the operator should review the following in their order of
    precedence:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Airworthiness Directives (AD's)</li>
    <li>Airworthiness Limitations Section of this Manual</li>
    <li>Recommended Time Limits Section of this Manual</li>
    <li>Suggested Time Limits Section of this Manual</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these recommendations or suggestions override the need for condition inspections and replacement of items
    should it be needed. If a required item is noticed to be in unserviceable condition prior to a recommended or
    suggested replacement interval, replace it!</p>
