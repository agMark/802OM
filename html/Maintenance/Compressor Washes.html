<p>Compressor washes are performed to remove dirt and deposits, which hamper the efficiency of the compressor. The quality of the Air Tractor induction system is so good that most engines require a compressor wash only once a year. An inspection of your engine inlet is a good indicator of when to perform a compressor wash. If the first stage compressor blades and/or cone on the inside of your engine inlet are dirty, then the compressor is too. Anything going into the compressor has to go by here. If the engine inlet cone is clean, you can be sure the inside of your engine is in pretty good shape. Don’t do a compressor wash just to be doing one. </p>

<p>See Figure 51 for the location of engine combustion drains to be opened for compressor washes. Regardless of how many compressor washes you do, there is only one way to accomplish the tank with maximum results. Remove the engine cowling and the air inlet cover over the engine inlet. Connect and start the battery charger. Remove the P3 filter (located on the right side at the rear of the engine) and leave the filter bowl off. If your engine does not have a P3 filter, remove the compressor discharge line from the right hand side of the FCU. Remove the two gas generator case fuel drain valves to allow the dirty water to escape rapidly. The newer PT6 engines have a P3 filter bowl that has a drain fitting to allow for compressor washing without having to disconnect anything. </p>

<p>If you do not remove the valves, what happens inside you engine strongly resembles the bathtub after the kids finish their bath. The rings left in the engine will do more harm than the washing does good. </p>

<p>The P&WC maintenance manual lists all the approved compressor washing materials. The manual also gives the proper mixing ratios for the wash solution. </p>

<div class=”boxCautionLarge”>
    <p class=”boxCautionLargeHeader”>CAUTION</p>
    <p class=”boxCautionLargeText”>Do <u>NOT</u> mix compressor washing materials in stronger strenghts than shown in the P&WC manual. The ratios are the MAXIMUM allowed. An operator may do more damage than good if trying to wash a compressor with a higher concentration of cleaning agen than that recommended by P&WC.</p>
</div>

<p>Prior to performing a compressor wash, the engine MUST be allowed to cool for a minimum of three hours to avoid stressing HSI components. </p>

<p>Most Air Tractors have a built in wash ring, which allows the washing solution to be injected into the compressor at the most efficient rate. Access to the wash ring is by removing the AN cap from the fitting located in the engine cowl corner skin under the left hand exhaust stack. The same wash ring is to be used to inject fresh clean water of drinking quality for rinsing purposes after the wash solution has been injected. A small, low pressure (approximately 20 psi) water pump, such as a boat bilge pump, will do the job. If you have relatively low concentrations of minerals in your tap water, a garden hose can be plumbed to the wash ring fitting directly to the tap for rinsing. You should use water that is as free form mineral concentration as possible. If you live in an area that has high concentrations of minerals in the tap water, it is advisable to use demineralized water. The engine should be rinsed (monitoring the started limitations) until the liquid draining from the engine drains in clear water. It is most important to insure all the washing agent (soap) has been rinsed out of the engine. After compressor wash is finished, start and run the engine at high idle for 3 to 5 minutes to dry out the compressor. </p>

<p>A turbine wash using P&WC tool p/n PWC32271 (cost approx. $275.00) is very effective in removing materials, which may have been allowed to accumulate on CT blades. Some of these materials may cause sulphidation, a form of high temperature corrosion that actively attacks the parent metal of compressor turbine blades. Use of this tool has proven to be very effective in reducing the numbers of CT blades rejected at HSI due to sulphidation. </p>

<p>P&WC will not honor warranty on CT Blades removed due to sulphidation. </p>

<p>After the water stops dripping out of the engine, replace the fuel drain valves and safety them, replace the air inlet cover, P3 filter and engine cowling. When everything has been replaced, start the engine and run for at least 15 minutes to dry the engine out. Never put the airplane up without running the engine until it is dry. </p>
