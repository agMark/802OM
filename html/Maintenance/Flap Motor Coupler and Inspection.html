<p>
    The B100-6 coupling provides a cushioned connection between the flap motor and the flap actuator gearbox.  The coupling transfers the driving torque from the motor to the actuator when raising or lowering the flaps.  When the flaps are not in motion, the coupler transfers a braking torque from the motor to prevent the actuator from being back driven.  
</p>

<p>
    The coupling consists of two metal bars inserted in a rubber disk.  When viewed from one side of the disk, the two bars appear as a driven bar and a driving bar in the hole in the center of the coupling.  The bars are one behind the other and 90° to one another.

<p>
   The B100-6 coupling has a finite life that is dependent on how often and under what conditions the flaps are used.  A torn coupler could prevent flap movement or cause an un-commanded flap retraction.  It is recommended that the flap coupling be inspected every 100 hours and 300 hours per the instructions below.  Replacement of the coupling is suggested in place of the 300-hour inspection.  
</p>

<p><b>Inspection</b></p>

<p>
    Inspection of the flap coupler was previously accomplished per Service Letter SL260.  The inspections below supersedes the inspection procedure shown in SL260.
</p>

<p>
    Every 100 hours:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Rotate the flap coupling by hand to inspect the flap coupling for distortion, or splits in the rubber.  If any distortion or splits are found, replace the coupling. 
    </li>
    <li>
        While rotating the coupling, feel for any play or backlash.  If play or backlash is felt, remove the coupling and perform the 300-hour inspection below.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Every 300 hours:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Remove the flap motor from the flap actuator to access the coupling.  
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect the rubber for splits or distortion when viewed from the front or side.  The angle between the metal bars should show no more than 5° deviation from the standard 90°, with no bends in the individual bars.  The existence of any of these conditions requires replacement of the coupling.
