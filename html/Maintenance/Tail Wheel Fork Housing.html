    The housing is attached to the tail spring with two NAS154DH-32 bolts, and MS20995C32 safety wire ties the bolt heads together. These bolts have a tendency to loosen in service, particularly in the first 100 hours of operation as paint between mating surfaces is compressed. At 100 hour intervals, the tail wheel should be jacked clear of the ground, and with the locking pin in place give the tail wheel a vigorous tug from side to side to check the movement between the housing and the spring.

    for recommended replacement times and bolt torques. Be sure to grease the bolts before installation with anti-seizing lubricant per MIL-A-907E or equivalent. An added precaution would be to apply this lubricant to the threads of the housing to prevent the bolt from seizing.

<p>A Timken Roller bearing is installed at the lower end of the fork housing assembly. This bearing consists of a Timken 28995 cone and a 28920 cup. The seal is a p/n 40115-1. The large bronze bushing inside the housing is p/n 40124-1 (upper). The bushing is pressed into place and may be driven out with a pin punch. The housing assembly is p/n 40118-1 which is less bushing, bearing, seal, and grease fitting. </p>
