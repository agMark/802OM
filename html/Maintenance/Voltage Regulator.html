<p>The wiring schematic for the Voltage Regulator is shown in Figure 11. This solid-state Voltage Regulator controls the generator output at 27.5 volts. The Voltage Regulator is activated by closure of the generator switch. When the generator output has risen to near 27.5 volts, a signal from the Voltage Regulator activates the line contact relay, placing the generator on-line. The line contact relay performs the same function as the older reverse-current relay in taking the generator off-line when the generator output voltage falls below residual battery voltage. </p>

<p>The Voltage Regulator uses logic based on the status of the system to control the regulator output. This logic uses samples of voltages in the system to determine the current system condition. These include voltages on both sides of the line contactor relay to determine if the relay is open or closed. Also, voltages at the starter switch are monitored to determine the position of the starter switch. </p>

<p>The voltage output of the Voltage Regulator is pre-set to 27.5 volts. The voltage output may be set to between 26 to 28.5 volts by adjusting the voltage-adjustment screw at the end of the case. The plug screw must be removed to allow access to the voltage-adjustment screw inside. </p>
