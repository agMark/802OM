<p>
    Several issues have been reported regarding the Air Tractor throttle quadrant when insufficient or no friction is applied.  See Service Letters 341 and 352.

<p>
    The proper setting of the friction adjustment knob is the tightest 
    setting that still allows for smooth operation of the power lever. 
    The knob should be tight enough so that there is no side-to-side play 
    of any of the quadrant controls. Side-to-side play of the controls 
    can lead to the power lever being able to move into the reverse 
    position without actuating the reverse-lockout latch. This could 
    possibly lead to a dangerous application of reverse-thrust in flight. 
</p>

<p>
    The friction adjustment knob should be tight enough that movement of 
    the power lever will not affect the position of the condition lever 
    (red) or propeller control lever (blue). 
</p>

<p>
    The knob should not be so tight that the power lever can't be 
    operated without a rough or jerky motion. 
</p>

<p>
    The friction adjustment knob has right-handed threads so turning the 
    knob clockwise tightens the knob and turning counter-clockwise 
    loosens the knob. 
</p>

<p>
    If your throttle quadrant has not already been modified per SL352 to include the anti-reverse fence, 
    this should be done as soon as possible.
