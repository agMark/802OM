    It is recommended that the technician have a padded bench top or table nearby onto which lay the removed rudder. It
    is also highly encouraged that a second person assists with the removal and installation of the rudder in order to
    prevent damage to the aircraft or control surface.
</p>

<p><b>Removal</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Center the rudder pedals in the cockpit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the bolts, washers and nuts and disconnect the left-hand and right-hand rudder control cables from the
        rudder horn. The cable ends should be secured out of the way to prevent future interference and kinking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the bolts, washer and nuts and disconnect the rudder boost tab pushrod at either the forward bellcrank or
        directly at the boost tab horn. The entire pushrod may be removed if desired. Secure the pushrod out of the way
        if it will remain attached to structure during rudder removal.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disconnect the white position light wiring from the fuselage. This will be done either by disconnecting wrist
        locks or a Delphi automotive-style connector. For airplanes made prior to 2025 with the Delphi connector, it is
        likely that you will need to de-pin the connector. Remove fuselage skin panels as needed to gain access to
        wiring connections.

                Be especially aware of risk of pinching

        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove all of the nuts and washers at each rudder hinge point. You may also remove the center hinge point bolt
        but leave the lower and upper hinge point bolts temporarily in place.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a second person is available for assistance, have them support the weight and
        position of the rudder while the other technician removes the bolts from the lower and upper hinge points. Care
        should be taken since the rudder will most likely be top-heavy due to the counterweights installed in the
        aerodynamic horn.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Now is a good time to inspect the hinge bearings for condition and security. If any substantial repairs affecting
    the weight are made to the rudder, the surface may need to have the balance checked before reinstallation.
</p>

<p><b>Installation</b></p>

<ul>
    Installation is the reverse of removal. The technician may wish to remove fuselage skin panels in order to visually
    verify that the rudder control cables have not fallen off of the pulley guide wheels or have become mis-routed while
    loose before returning the aircraft to service. Tension for the rudder control cables 
    should be snug enough to not allow cables to fall off of pulley wheels or so tight that the cables
    cause unusual wear in the pulley wheels or fairleads.
</ul>
