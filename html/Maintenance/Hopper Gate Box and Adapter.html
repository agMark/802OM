<p>Gaskets for both should be replaced when either is removed. The original and new gaskets should not be mixed when replacing. Gaskets for the adapter to gate box connection are Transland p/n 60227 (2 ea.) and 60725 (2 ea.). Bolts for attaching the adaptor to the hoppers are stainless 1.0 inch long p/n 91246A542. Bolts for the gate box attach are 5/8 long p/n 91246A539. These bolts are installed with AN960C416 washers and MS21044C4 nuts. Gaskets should be sealed on both sides with PR1422-B2. Bolt torque is 150 inch-pounds. </p>

<p>The gate box and adapter may be removed by use of the following procedure: </p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Remove fuselage side skins adjacent to the hopper tank.</li>
    <li>Remove the gate control rod attachments to the gate box.</li>
    <li>Remove attachments to spray pump line. </li>
    <li>Remove the bolts that attach the gate box to the hopper adapter and lower the gate box gently to the ground.</li>
    <li>Remove the bottom-load fill attachments to the adapter.</li>
    <li>Remove the hose couplings between the hopper vent outlets and the vent stacks inside and on both sides of the hopper adapter.</li>
    <li>Remove all bolts that connect the adapter to the hopper-bottom flanges and lower the adapter gently to the ground.</li>
</ol>

<p>The gate box and adapter may be replaced by reversing the removal procedure. Clean surfaces of all old sealant. Wipe down surfaces with solvent to remove all residues. Install the adapter and gatebox with new gaskets and PR1422 sealer. </p>
