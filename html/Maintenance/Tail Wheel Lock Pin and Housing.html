<p>
    When engaged, the tail wheel lock mechanism allows the tail wheel to be locked in a trailing position to aid in
    tracking straight down the runway during takeoff and taxiing. It is important that the tail wheel lock be adjusted
    to maintain this straight tracking to reduce pilot workload and reduce wear on tires and brakes. If the tail wheel
    lock adjustment does not allow the aircraft to taxi straight down the runway/taxiway in a no-wind condition, then it
    may be adjusted.
</p>
<p>
    There are two different tail wheel lock mechanisms. The "original" and the Sure Lock. The Sure Lock mechanism became
    standard in 2018-2019. For operators that are wishing to change from the original lock mechanism to the Sure Lock mechanism, please refer to Service Letter #373.

<p class="dontBreakAfter"><b>Adjustment - Original Tail Wheel Lock Mechanism</b></p>
<p>
    The lock pin housing is p/n 40025-6 and attaches to the steel plate on the lower end of the fork housing with four
    countersunk screws. The four holes in the base of the lock pin housing are oversize to allow adjustment of the
    locking pin. If the aircraft tends to steer to the left or to the right on the ground with the lock pin engaged, it
    is necessary to re-position the lock pin housing. Jack the tail wheel clear of the ground, lift the lock pin up and
    swivel the fork to one side so that the four screw heads are exposed. Make a pencil mark along the edge of the lock
    pin housing plate for a reference and estimate the amount of movement for the lock pin housing.
</p>
<p>
    Loosen the 4 screws and move the housing the desired direction. Swivel the fork back into position and allow the
    locking pin to engage the fork, then tighten the two outboard screws. Then rotate the fork back so that the two
    inboard screws can be tightened. Check the lock pin again to see that it freely engages the fork. Taxi the aircraft
    on a smooth level surface in a no-wind condition, or if there is a light wind, taxi both up-wind and down-wind with
    the rudder pedals in the neutral position and the stick back so that you are sure the lock pin is engaged. Keep
    adjusting the locking pin housing until the aircraft will taxi in a straight line.

<p>Details of the legacy tail-wheel lock-pin housing are shown below.</p>



<p><b>Inspection - Original Tail Wheel Lock Mechanism</b></p>
<p>
    During 12-month inspections (or more frequently if required) remove the housing and slide out the locking pin to
    check it for wear and straightness. The compression spring inside the housing should also be checked for broken
    coils. The locking pin is p/n 40131-1 and the spring is p/n 40026-1. If the lock pin bushing is worn it should be
    replaced by installing the SL #171 repair kit, available from your Air Tractor dealer.
</p>

<p><b>Inspection - Sure Lock Tail Wheel Lock Mechanism</b></p>
<p>
    Remove the tail wheel locking mechanism by removing the 4 bolts on the top of the housing, check pin for
    straightness and wear. Lubricate, reinstall. Check alignment and adjustment.
</p>

<p>For serial numbers -0089 thru -0118 plus those retrofitted with stainless steel tailwheel unlock rods -- there has been a report of the tail wheel unlock rod binding in the fairleads. Inspect the fairleads and insure that the hole through the fairleads is .323" (Letter "P" Drill). Any fairleads with a hole smaller than .323" should be replaced with a 70122-2 fairlead per Service Letter #222.</p>

<p>From time to time the tail-wheel-lock-pin bushing, located in the tail-wheel-fork-lock-pin-striker plate, becomes worn and needs replacing. The original bushing was a press in type. After pressing the bushing in place, we also staked it at the factory on installation. After receiving reports that the bushing would sometimes become loose and fall out, we began tack welding the bushing in place instead of staking it. </p>

<p>To facilitate field repair of loose, worn, or missing lock pin bushings, Air Tractor has designed a new bolt in bushing. To install the new P/N 40154-1 bushing in your airplane, refer to Service Letter #171.</p>
