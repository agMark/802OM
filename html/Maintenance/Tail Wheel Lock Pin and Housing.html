<p>The lock pin housing is p/n 40025-6 and attaches to the steel plate on the lower end of the fork housing with four countersunk screws. The four holes in the base of the lock pin housing are oversize to allow adjustment of the locking pin. If the aircraft tends to steer to the left or to the right on the ground with the lock pin engaged, it is necessary to re-position the lock pin housing. Jack the tail wheel clear of the ground, lift the lock pin up and swivel the fork to one side so that the four screw heads are exposed. Make a pencil mark along the edge of the lock pin housing plate for a reference and estimate the amount of movement for the lock pin housing. </p>

<p>Loosen the 4 screws and move the housing the desired direction. Swivel the fork back into position and allow the locking pin to engage the fork, then tighten the two outboard screws. Then rotate the fork back so that the two inboard screws can be tightened. Check the lock pin again to see that it freely engages the fork. Taxi the aircraft on a smooth level surface in a no-wind condition, or if there is a light wind, taxi both up-wind and down-wind with the rudder pedals in the neutral position and the stick back so that you are sure the lock pin is engaged. Keep adjusting the locking pin housing until the aircraft will taxi in a straight line. </p>

<p>During 12-month inspections (or more frequently if required) remove the housing and slide out the locking pin to check it for wear and straightness. The compression spring inside the housing should also be checked for broken coils. The locking pin is p/n 40131-1 and the spring is p/n 40026-1. If the lock pin bushing is worn it should be replaced by installing the SL #171 repair kit, available from your Air Tractor dealer. </p>
