<p>Access to the batteries is shown in Figure 31. The batteries on your turbine will require REGULAR servicing. Your batteries will last longer if you maintain the proper water level and the proper voltage on the voltage regulator. Too high a voltage on the regulator will boil the batteries. Most operators use a digital voltmeter to set the regulator to a measured voltage of 27.5. </p>

<p>One of the hardest things on your batteries is neglect in the off-season. Air Tractors with Crophawk flow meters or anything else wired direct to the battery should be disconnected during the off-season so as not to drain the battery. Periodic checks should be made during the off-season to insure that the batteries stay charged. You may turn on the master switch and read battery voltage on the voltmeter. Batteries below 22 volts should be put on the charger and charged back to full strength. If you will keep them serviced during the season and give them a little maintenance in the off-season, their longevity will increase. Don't forget to drain the battery acid sump at regular intervals as described in Figure 31. Keep the batteries clean. Dirt and acid on the outside of the battery provide a path for a slight flow of electricity. This will discharge a battery in time. </p>
