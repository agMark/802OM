<p>The wiring schematic for the Starter/Generator is shown in Figure 11. When the starter switch is engaged, a small current is sent to the coil for the starter relay. This relay completes the circuit to provide starting current to the starter.  The Starter/Generator, while acting as a generator, will produce 250 amps continuously. </p>
