<p>The brake disc is a Cleveland p/n 164-23001 and is attached to the bolts that attach the two rim halves together. The wheel must be removed from the aircraft per <xref sectionTarget="2.90.2" prependLabel="Section"></xref>, the tire deflated, and the wheel dis-assembled in order to remove the brake disc. With the new brake disc in place, re-assemble wheel and tire per previous instructions. </p>

<p>Under average field conditions a brake disc should give years of trouble free service. However, unimproved fields, standing water, heavy industrial pollution, or infrequent use of the aircraft may necessitate more frequent inspection of discs to prolong the life of the brake lining. </p>

<p>Generally, the disc faces should be checked for wear, grooves, deep scratches, excessive general pitting or coning of the break disc. Coning beyond 0.015 inch in either direction would be cause for replacement. 

    Single or isolated grooves up to 0.030 inch deep should not be cause for replacement, although general grooving of the disc faces will reduce lining life. </p>
