    The propeller overspeed solenoid provides is used to test the functionality of the propeller overspeed governor which switches the hydraulic propeller-control circuit from variable RPM to fixed RPM in the event of primary governor failure.  When activated, this circuit maintains propeller RPM to 30-to-60 RPM below the engine's maximum of 1700 RPM.  The system is operated with a switch that is installed on the lower panel.
