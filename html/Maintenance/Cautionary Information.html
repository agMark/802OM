    <li>Pressure Release
        <p>Before disconnecting any lines or removing the oil plug, always make sure refrigerant has been removed from
            the
            air conditioning system by recovering it with the appropriate recovery equipment.
            When working on compressors separate from the system, always be sure to relieve internal pressure first.
            Internal compressor pressure can be relieved by removing shipping caps / pads from both ports.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Recovery of Refrigerant
        <p>Never discharge refrigerant to the atmosphere. Always use approved refrigerant recovery / recycling equipment
            to
            capture refrigerant which is removed from the air conditioning system. Do not mix refrigerants in the same
            piece
            of equipment; one should be designated for R-12 and another for R-134a. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Handling of Refrigerant
        <p>Always wear eye and hand protection when working on an air conditioning system or compressor. Liquid
            refrigerant
            can cause frostbite and / or blindness. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Ventilation
        <p>Keep refrigerants and oils away from open flames. Refrigerants can produce poisonous gasses in the presence
            of a
            flame. Work in a well-ventilated area. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Avoid Use of Compressed Air
        <p>Do not introduce compressed air into an air conditioning system due to the danger of contamination. </p>
