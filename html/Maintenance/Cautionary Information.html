    <li>Pressure Release</li>
    <p>Before disconnecting any lines or removing the oil plug, always make sure refrigerant has been removed from the
        air conditioning system by recovering it with the appropriate recovery equipment.
        When working on compressors, separate from the system, always be sure to relieve internal pressure first.
        Internal compressor pressure can be relieved by removing shipping caps / pads from both ports.
    </p>
    <li>Recovery of Refrigerant</li>
    <p>Never discharge refrigerant to the atmosphere. Always use approved refrigerant recovery / recycling equipment to
        capture refrigerant which is removed from the air conditioning system. Do not mix refrigerants in the same piece
        of equipment; one should be designated for R-12 and another for R-134a. </p>

    <li>Handling of Refrigerant</li>
    <p>Always wear eye and hand protection when working on an air conditioning system or compressor. Liquid refrigerant
        can cause frostbite and / or blindness. </p>
    <li>Ventilation</li>
    <p>Keep refrigerants and oils away from open flames. Refrigerants can produce poisonous gasses in the presence of a
        flame. Work in a well-ventilated area. </p>
    <li>Avoid Use of Compressed Air</li>
    <p>Do not introduce compressed air into an air conditioning system due to the danger of contamination. </p>

    <p style="color: red;">Note: Recycling machines must be validated to the appropriate SAE standard and by Underwriters Laboratories.
        Recycled refrigerant from other sources must meet the appropriate ARI standards. Failure to comply with these
        provisions may void any warranty on the compressor. </p>
