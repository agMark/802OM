    <li>The paint stripper most effective on urethane paint is Turco #5351. </li>
    <li>The stripper is either sprayed on with a barrel pump or applied on small parts with a large paint brush.  If sprayed on be sure to consider wind direction so that over-spray will not damage surrounding vehicles or aircraft.</li>
    <li>When applying stripper, wear protective clothing and safety goggles.</li>
    <li>Apply a medium to heavy coat of stripper.  Temperature should be 50° F or warmer for best results.  Allow stripper to react with paint and remove with special brush having stiff bristles that will not soften with stripper. </li>
    <li>Spray on a second light coat of stripper as necessary and remove remaining paint with brush. </li>
    <li>Rinse thoroughly with (approx. 150° F) water under pressure.  Be sure entire film of stripper is removed. </li>
    <li>Apply Acid Etch with Scotch Brite pads and scrub metal surfaces thoroughly.  Rinse with cold water. </li>
    <li>Before the part is dry, apply generous amounts of Alodine with a clean white rag.  The Alodine should act within two or three minutes and when rinsed off with cold water should leave a very light gold surface.  Do not leave the Alodine too long or allow it to dry as a dark brown film will result which is undesirable and should be removed and the part reprocessed. </li>
    <li>When the part is completely dry, apply a coat of High Solids Epoxy Primer: 
        <p>9.1	Always follow manufacturer’s recommended mixing ratio of pigmented component to adduct. </p>
        <p>9.2.	Surfaces must be clean and free of grease, dirt, oil, rust, fingerprints, and other contaminants to insure optimum adhesion and performance properties.  Parts may be cleaned using an alcohol 	soaked soft white rag. </p>
        <p>9.3.	Apply primer using conventional spray equipment or HVLP spray equipment. </p>
        <p>9.4.	Ideal coating thickness is 0.5 mils dry. </p>
        <p>9.5.	Spray coatings with smooth, even strokes.  Runs and sags are to be avoided. </p>
        <p>9.6.	Application temperature should be between 65°-100° F. </p>
        <p>9.7.	Epoxy primer should be allowed to flash before re-coating with epoxy primer. </p>
        <p>9.8. Air dry time to topcoat at 77°-100° F is 2 hours minimum. </p>
        <p>9. 9. Full cure is achieved after approximately 18 hours of air dry. </p>
        <p>9.10. If parts are allowed to dry in excess of 48 hours before topcoat application, they must be sanded 	and re-primed. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Apply Urethane Topcoat on Primed Parts: 
    <p>10.1. Always follow manufacturer recommended mixing ratio of hardener, base component, and activator. </p>
    <p>10.2. Surfaces must be clean and free of grease, dirt, oil, rust, fingerprints, and other contaminants to insure optimum adhesion and performance properties.  Parts may be cleaned using an alcohol 	soaked lint-free cotton cloth. </p>
    <p>10.3. Parts should be wiped with a urethane grade tack cloth and then air blown to remove any foreign materials. </p>
    <p>10.4. Mix topcoat in accordance with manufacturer instructions.  Do not deviate from manufacturer recommended mixing ratios. </p>
    <p>10.5. The paint booth temperature should be maintained between 65°-100°F.  Ideal booth conditions are 75°-85° F and a relative humidity of 45%. </p>
    <p>10.6. Apply topcoat using conventional spray equipment or HVLP spray equipment. </p>
    <p>10.7. Ideal coating thickness is 2.8 - 3.5 mils dry. </p>
    <p>10.8. Spray coatings with smooth, even strokes.  Runs and sags are to be avoided. </p>
    <p>10.9. Cure time is 4.5 hours to tape at 120° F, or 6-8 hours to tape at 77° F. </p>
    <p>10.10. Clean equipment using Ketone (MEK) solvent.  Do not allow material to cure inside spray equipment. </p>
