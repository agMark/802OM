<p>This control is a red handle that is mounted in the lefthand side of the cockpit. This handle is equipped with a spring loaded locking trigger that will keep the lever in the “OFF” position but allow quick and easy operability in the event that the system is needed.</p>

<p>Air Tractor has strengthened and reinforced the locking lever to provide added resistance from damage. The changes also provide a removable T-Pin with a “REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT” flag that can be used to lock the handle in the “OFF” position during maintenance and ground operations. This T-Pin is installed so that it can only be fully inserted when the handle is fully in the “OFF” position. </p>

<p>This T-Pin should be removed before flight so that the FCU override is quickly available in the event of an emergency. The T-Pin can be inserted from either the inboard side or outboard side of the handle.</p>

<p>AT-802/802A serial number -0001 thru -0536 and AT-802 serial number -4001 thru -4025 did not have this T-pin installed at the factory, but technicians can incorporate this improvement on their aircraft using the data in Service Letter #318.</p>
