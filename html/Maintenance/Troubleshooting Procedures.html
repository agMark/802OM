<p>Recommended sequences for troubleshooting the charging system are shown below</p>

<p>Static Tests- Before going into specific Symptoms, which will result in, operational squawks  it is productive to point out a static test routine that is quick and easy and will result in localizing some problems without starting the engine. This procedure entails removing the connector from the GCU and checking with the ohmmeter fro designated sockets in test leads will usually have a small resistance, about .1 to .4 ohms, so before starting, short the probes together and get this reading. Subtract this reading from all point to point readings. </p>

<p>Initial Setup - Master Switch OFF, Generator Switch ON. </p>

<p>In the following, the expression “GEN will not come on line" is evidence by a low Lower Instrument Panel Voltmeter reading (25V or lower) and the LV Light staying on. </p>

<p>Symptom- After engine start, GEN will not come on line unless the Start Switch is engaged momentarily after the Generator Switch is turned on. </p>

<p>Probable Cause- Field Flash function of GCU inoperative. </p>

<p>Fix- Repair or replace GCU. </p>

<p>Notes- The system can be operated as described without creating further detrimental effects until a convenient time to have the GCU replaced or repaired. </p>

<p>Symptom- During engine shutdown the starter continues to run if the Generator Switch is left ON.
</p>

<p>Probable Cause- Reverse Current Protection function of GCU is defective. </p>

<p>Fix- Repair or replace GCU. </p>

<p>Notes- Turning the Generator Switch off prior to engine shutdown will correct this condition as a stopgap measure but the operator should be aware that if this precaution is overlooked damage to the starter generator can result. </p>

<p>Symptom- After an engine start the Generator will not come on line (low VM reading and/or LV Lite ON) but normal generator output voltage exists (nominally 28V) at A1 of the LCR. </p>

<p>Probable Causes- This symptom would indicate that the Generator has built up and is being regulated but the LCR is not connecting the Generator to the Bus. This can be caused by: </p>

    <p>a) Bad LCR, check for 56 ohms through LCR Coil.</p>
    <p>b) Check the 120 Amp Bus Circuit Breaker. </p>

    <p>c) No output (nominally 28V) on pin H of the GCU (defective GCU).</p>

    <p>d) Output on pin H but no voltage on X2 of LCR (defective wiring).</p>

    <p>e) Normal voltage (nominally 28V) from X2 to X1 of LCR (defective LCR).</p>

    <p>f) Normal voltage (nominally 28V) from both X2 and X1 of LCR (open ground wire). </p>

        <p>Fix- </p>

    <p>b) Replace or repair GCU</p>

    <p>c) and e) Ring out and repair wiring as required </p>

    <p> d) Replace LCR</p>

<p>Symptom - After an engine start the Generator won’t come on line and the voltage at A1 to the LCR is only about 1 Volt and there is no voltage on pin J of the GCU. </p>

<p>Probable Cause - There is a discontinuity in the circuit feeding power to the GCU, which includes the wiring, the 15A C/B, Generator Switch, and the Start Switch. </p>

<p>Fix - Make sure that the 15A C/B is not tripped and that the Generator Switch is ON and then proceed to ring out and isolate the discontinuity from A1 of the LCR to pin J. </p>

<p>Symptom - The Generator won’t come on line and the voltage on A1 of the LCR is low (9-16V). </p>

<p>Probable Cause - The Voltage Regulator section of the GCU is defective. </p>

<p>Fix - Repair or replace the GCU. </p>

<p>Symptom - The Lower Instrument Panel Voltmeter indicates rapidly increasing bus voltage and then at about 32V suddenly drops to about 24V and then slowly decreases as the batteries discharge. </p>

<p>Probable Cause - This is indicative of an Overvoltage trip and may be accompanied by the 15A C/B tripping. In those cases where the C/B does not trip the system can be restored to normal operation by momentarily turning the Generator Switch off and back on. </p>

<p>Fix - If resetting the C/B or cycling the Generator Switch restores the system and the Generator stays on line the GCU is suspect of an intermittent condition. If the symptoms repeat the GCU is faulty and should be repaired or replaced. </p>
