<b>Flap Actuator Troubleshooting</b>

<p>If any trouble develops, first check both the flap circuit breaker and flap switch circuit breaker on the panel. If this does not produce any results, a visual inspection of the micro-switches and micro-switch arms should be made. Enter the fuselage and inspect the micro-switches for broken actuator arms or loose wires. Inspect the relays for broken or loose wires. </p>

<p>If the flaps are up but won’t go down, chances are there is something wrong with the down micro-switch, or down relay. If the flaps are down but won’t go up, look for trouble with the up micro-switch, or up relay. If it is necessary to keep flying and make repairs later, the flaps can be retracted by rotating, by hand, the rubber coupling at the motor shaft. This is slow, but the flaps can be raised this way. </p>

<p>If the flap goes down past the 30° mark, check the down micro-switch. Have someone cycle the flaps and see if the roller on the micro-switch arm lifts properly on the striker plate and pushes in the micro-switch plunger to stop the travel. If there is any doubt, push the plunger in with the flap midway through the stroke. If the switch is working, the flap will stop. In this case, the down micro-switch needs to be re-positioned to activate the micro-switch. </p>

<p>Check the micro-switches with an Ohmmeter. Check continuity between the C pin and the N.C. pin on both switches. Activate the switch by pushing the plunger in and check continuity between the C pin and the N.O. pin. If these checks are positive, the micro switches are OK and do not need to be changed. If a switch is bad, change it. </p>
