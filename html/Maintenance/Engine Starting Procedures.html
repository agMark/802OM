    Starting the PT6A turbine engine is not complicated, but it is the best opportunity you will have to damage your engine if the proper procedures are not followed. A battery cart will be a good investment. You can take two 12V truck batteries wired in series for 24 volts, put them in a cart for ease of movement, and connect them to cables with a plug compatible to your Air Tractor. It is also convenient to wire a trickle charger to a female socket like your airplane has and you can keep the batteries plugged in when not in use so they will always be ready when needed.

    Before you begin the starting procedure, make sure all the levers and switches are in their proper positions. The throttle against the idle stop, the start lever in the cut off position, the propeller in feather, and the ignition switch in the middle position. Well charged batteries or the battery cart will spin your engine between 18% and 20% Ng. NEVER TRY TO START AN ENGINE TURNING LESS THAN 15%. Once you have obtained an Ng speed above 15%, turn on your ignitors, wait for the Ng speed to peak, them bring the start lever to the RUN position. Start counting 1001, 1002, 1003, etc. your engine should ignite before you reach 1005. If it does not, pull the start lever back to cut off, let off the start switch, and investigate. In any case, allow the fuel in your engine to drain. You do not want to start an engine with a lot of excess fuel inside. Most engines will light around 1003. There will be a pause in most engines around 35% Ng, then a continuation on the 58% to 60% Ng. The ITT will usually peak and be coming down as the engine reaches its idle speed. Engine with the 10-4 fuel nozzle configuration will start well under the red line, (usually more than 100Â° C) while the 7-7 configuration will start somewhat hotter. In no case should an engine normally exceed the red line on a start, although the manual allows temperatures above the red line for 5 seconds (See Airplane Flight Manual).

    Once the engine is above 56% Ng, release the starter switch. You may leave the ignitor switch in the up position since the ignitors are OFF as soon as the start switch is released. Turn on the generator. Right after a start, especially without a battery cart, your generator will be carrying a heavy load while recharging the batteries, and can drag the engine down. If your Ng speed begins to fall below 58% when you turn on the generator, you should advance the power level as required to maintain a Ng speed above 58%.

    Starting an engine that is turning slow with weak batteries is asking for a disaster. During the start process, if anything seems questionable, pull the start lever back to the cut-off position with the starter still engaged and allow the starter to run till the ITT has fallen to safe limits. As stated at the beginning of this section, starting the engine is not hard, but you have to do it right or you will find yourself in a trap. Most over temperature conditions occur as a result of improper starting. Repairs to your engine, caused by an over-temperature condition, can be very expensive!
