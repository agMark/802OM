<p>Fuel nozzles are the most important routine maintenance item on your engine. No one single item has as much direct effect on the condition of the inside of your engine. Dirty fuel nozzles can ruin combustion liners, guide vanes, turbine blades, and the gas generator case. Fuel nozzles are not cleaned WHEN they are dirty, but to keep them from BECOMING DIRTY. Your fuel nozzles may be cleaned by your maintenance personnel or they may be sent to a number of locations for cleaning and returned to you for installation. Air Tractor recommends nozzle cleaning at 300 hour intervals as long as you are using Jet A fuel, and you are getting good reports from the personnel cleaning the nozzles you remove. </p>

<p>The earlier model of PT6A engines came with 7 primary and 7 secondary nozzles. The engine starts on the primary nozzles and at about 35% Ng the secondary nozzles come in. The engineers at Pratt & Whitney have discovered that the engine will start cooler by reducing the number of secondary nozzles, hence Service Bulletin 1372. All the new engines from Pratt & Whitney come in the 10 primary / 4 secondary configuration. Most of the older engines have been converted, but if you have one that has not, converting it over will cool down your starting IT temperatures considerably. </p>

<p>To remove or install fuel nozzles, refer to the proper Pratt & Whitney manual in Section 1, INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORHTINESS. Write down the location of the primary and secondary nozzles. The primary nozzle may be identified by a weld spot on the flat area next to one of the bolts. See Figure 48. DO NOT MARK ON THE GAS GENERATOR CASE WITH A PENCIL. </p>
