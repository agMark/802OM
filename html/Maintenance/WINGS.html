<p>The wing is of all-metal construction with the main spar designed to take the entire bending load. Thick wing skins are employed near the wing root with a gradual drop in thickness at each skin lap as wing loads diminish. No span-wise stringers are used in order to simplify construction and repairs and for that reason wrinkles in the upper skin and cans between the ribs will be noticed during maneuvers with heavy loads. This is a natural condition and unless the cans or wrinkles change noticeably in a particular location there is no cause for alarm. Any changes as mentioned would require close inspection of all internal structural parts in the area where the change has taken place. </p>

<p>The wing leading edge is of .040 thick 2024-T3 and can be replaced in the field as described under the Repairs section of this manual. The wing rear spar attach plate is of 5/16" thick 4130N steel for extra strength and resistance to corrosion during fertilizer applications. It is cadmium plated and primed with Chromanoxide epoxy primer before assembly to the rear spar. </p>

<p>All wing parts are cleaned with a detergent soap, scrubbed with an etching solution, and dipped into an Alodine 1200 solution, then primed before assembly. Skin laps on the top side of the wing are sealed with PR-1422 A2 as in the wing root to prevent chemical entry. </p>
