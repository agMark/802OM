<p>Details of the tail-wheel fork are shown below. The tail wheel fork may be removed from the housing by removing the single AN5C32A stainless bolt from the arm assembly that connects to the centering springs. With the fork removed, check for wear on the spindle at the bronze bearing location. Also check for condition of the steel bushing that the lock pin drops into. This bushing is pressed into the steel plate at the bottom end of the spindle and staked in four places on each side of the plate with a center punch. This holds the bushing in place since it has a beveled edge on both sides. This bushing is p/n 40042-1. Excess wear on the fork spindle at the bronze bearing location is indication that grease is not reaching the proper areas. To grease the bronze bearing properly, jack the tail wheel clear of the ground and apply MIL-G-81322 grease at the fitting on the housing, and rotate the fork until grease is running out of the full perimeter of both upper and lower bearings. Excessive wear in the spindle will require a new fork assembly, which is p/n 40117-1 and includes the steel lock pin bushing. The centering springs are p/n 40044-1 and attach to a p/n 40044-1 and attach to a p/n 40035-1 bracket that wears on a p/n 40036-1 bushing. The bolt is an AN4C7A. </p>
