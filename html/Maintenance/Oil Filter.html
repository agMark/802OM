    The oil filter, located to the right side of the air inlet case, is held in place by a cover with 4 nuts. Removing the 
    oil filter requires a special puller and should not be removed by any other means. Cleaning the filter may be 
    accomplished by gently agitating the element in clean solvent. After cleaning, allow the element to stand in a 
    clean environment until dry. Refer to the proper Pratt and Whitney Manual in <xref sectionTarget="1.0.2" xrefType="link" prependLabel="Section">Cross Reference Placeholder</xref>.

        Under no circumstances may the element be ultrasonically cleaned, pressure 
        flushed, or dried with compressed air. Such cleaning and drying causes damage to
