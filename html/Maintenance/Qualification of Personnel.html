    Maintenance to your plane is to be accomplished by or under the direct supervision of an authorized person or entity
    and is to be returned to service before the plane is operated. Inspections are to be accomplished by an
    appropriately rated person or entity and must determine that the plane is in airworthy condition. To be in airworthy
    condition the plane must meet the type design, the approved design from the factory, and or be altered in accordance
    with approved data.
