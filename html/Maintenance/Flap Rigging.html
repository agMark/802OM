<p>With the flap actuator in the UP position, the flap push-rods are adjusted so that the lower side of the flaps form a straight line with the lower side of the fuel tank at station 109.0. Flap travel from this point is then set at 30째 +/- 1.5째.  Flap markings on the flap are located opposite the wing flap bay upper skin so that the pilot will view the markings at 10째, 20째, and at full travel. </p>
