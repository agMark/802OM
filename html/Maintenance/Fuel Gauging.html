<b>Fuel Gauging </b>

<p>The wiring schematic for the fuel gauging system is shown in Figure 28. The fuel quantity is shown on the panel-mounted fuel gauges. Each of the wing fuel cells is gauged separately. The fuel quantity in each of the fuel tanks is displayed on the respective panel fuel gauge. </p>

<p>Each of the fuel tanks has two fuel-quantity sending elements. These two sending elements are connected in series electrically. The inboard sending element is active in sensing fuel level when the fuel level is in the lower third of the tank. </p>

<p>The outboard sending element is active when the fuel level is in the upper third of the tank. Both the elements are active when the fuel level is in the mid-range. </p>

<p>The inboard sender is insulated from ground by the ten insulating bushings that are used both sides of the five holes in its flange. The outboard sender is grounded through its mounting bolts. </p>

<p>The panel-mounted fuel gauges are micro-ammeters with a full-scale range of 100 micro amps. A circuit board is attached to the binding posts of the instruments. Circuitry on this board provides 4.3 -volt power supply for the fuel-gauging system. A trim-potentiometer is located in the back side of the upper instrument panel just to the left of center. This trimmer is used to calibrate the full-scale readings on the micro-ammeter.</p>
