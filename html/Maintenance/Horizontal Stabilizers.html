<p>The details of the horizontal stabilizer are shown in Figure 66.  The horizontal stabilizers require very little maintenance since they are all metal. They are attached to the fuselage frame with two AN5-7A bolts, which have a washer under the head, and two under the nut. On 12-month inspections the gap cover should be removed from the stabilizer and the bolt condition and torque checked. At the same time inspect the fuselage fittings closely for cracks. Torque is 200 inch-pounds at the nut. The gap covers are attached with 90008-1 stainless self-tapping screws which are Phillips truss head #4x1/4" long. A No. 39 hole is drilled for the screw installation. The S202VW rubber channel is a Cessna part and is attached with 3-M 8001 Adhesive. </p>

<p>The stabilizer is sealed on the ends with PR-1422 A2 to prevent chemical entry.  There are two eyebolts that attach to a welded steel brace inside the stabilizer for strut attachment.  Eyebolt replacement should be in accordance with SL 129. </p>

        <p>The factory procedure is to align the face of the eyebolts with the strut clevis before the nut on the eyebolt is fully torqued.  There is a plug button installed in the skin above the nut. </p>

        <p>There is a p/n 30602-1 (L/H) and 30602-2 (R/H) trim control idler attached to each stabilizer rear spar on the inboard end. Each trim idler has three Bunting P26-10 bushings press fit inside the welded assembly and a p/n 30605-1 spacer bushing that allows the AN3H43 attach bolts to be fully torqued (60 inch-pounds at the nut). The brackets that attach the trim idlers are p/n 30255-1 and 30255-2 but should never need replacing unless the AN3H43 bolt has become loose and caused wear in the holes. </p>

        <p>Two of the idler arms are attached to the push-rods connected to the trim tab horns and these arms have a Bunting P19-1 bushing press-fit into the idler arms. Both should be replaced when excessive trim tab free-play develops. The Bunting bushings are oil-impregnated, but if new ones are installed, fill the bushings to overflowing with general purpose oil and with finger pressure squeeze on the bushing ends to force the oil into the small cavities inside the bushings. The bushing connections should be oiled regularly. </p>
