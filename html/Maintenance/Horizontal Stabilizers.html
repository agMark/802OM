<p>
    The details of the horizontal stabilizer are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_66.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. The horizontal stabilizers require very little
    maintenance as they are composed of metal.  The stabilizer is sealed on the ends with PR-1422 A2 to prevent chemical entry.

<p><b>Attachment Bolts</b></p>
<p>    
    Until 1997, the horizontal stabilizers were attached to the fuselage frame with two AN5-7A bolts.   
</p>
<p>
    Since, the horizontal stabilizers are attached with NAS6605 bolts, MS20002-5 washers and ESNA F52N1610-054 nuts
    as shown in
    <xref fileTarget="img_HorizontalStabAttachmentFwd.png"></xref> and
    <xref fileTarget="img_HorizontalStabAttachmentFwd.png"></xref>
    .  Torque is 17 ft-lb (204 in-lb) on the nut.

</figure>

<p>    
    On 12-month inspections the gap cover should be removed from the
    stabilizer and the bolt condition and torque checked. At the same time inspect the fuselage fittings closely for
    cracks. 
</p>

<p><b>Eyebolts</b></p>
<p>
    Two eyebolts are installed inside the stabilizer for attachment of the struts.  Through SN 802A-0188, these eyebolts were AN47-30A.  They were then changed to 30775-1 with MS20002-9 washers and AN365-918 nuts.  See SL129 for modification instructions to the newer configuration with longer life.

    Replacement intervals for these eyebolts are provided in <xref sectionTarget="2.200.1" prependLabel="Section"></xref> which are the same as those provided in SL129.  Torque and installation details are provided below.

<p>If your aircraft is still equipped with AN47 eyebolts which originally used AN960 washers, it should be retrofitted with MS20002 washers per SL129B to avoid crushing of the washer.</p>






<p><b>Gap Covers</b></p>
<p>
    The gap covers are attached with 90008-1 stainless self-tapping screws
    which are Phillips truss head #4x1/4" long. A No. 39 hole is drilled for the screw installation. The Cessna S202VW rubber
    channel is attached with 3-M 8001 Adhesive.
</p>

<p><b>Trim Controls</b></p>

<p>
    There is a p/n 30602-1 (L/H) and 30602-2 (R/H) trim control idler attached to each stabilizer rear spar on the
    inboard end. Each trim idler has three Bunting P26-10 bushings press fit inside the welded assembly and a p/n
    30605-1 spacer bushing that allows the AN3H43 attach bolts to be fully torqued (60 inch-pounds at the nut). The
    brackets that attach the trim idlers are p/n 30255-1 and 30255-2 but should never need replacing unless the AN3H43
    bolt has become loose and caused wear in the holes. 
</p>

<p>
    Two of the idler arms are attached to the push-rods connected to the trim tab horns and these arms have a Bunting
    P19-1 bushing press-fit into the idler arms. Both should be replaced when excessive trim tab free-play develops. The
    Bunting bushings are oil-impregnated, but if new ones are installed, fill the bushings to overflowing with general
    purpose oil and with finger pressure squeeze on the bushing ends to force the oil into the small cavities inside the
    bushings. The bushing connections should be oiled regularly. 
</p>

<p><b>Abrasion Tape</b></p>

<p>
    3M 8671-3 Anti-abrasion tape is installed on the leading edge of the stabilizer.  This tape should be periodically checked for condition and replaced as required.  It is permissible to operate without the tape but expect paint life to be decreased.
