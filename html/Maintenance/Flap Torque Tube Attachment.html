<p>
    After cracks were reported in the flap actuator attachment plates on the flap torque tube, SL347 was issued in 2016.

<p>
    Several years later, the FAA issued AD 2021-05-14 which mandated the same inspections but slightly altered the requirements.
</p>

<p>
    This section attempt to simplify and harmonize both the Service Letter and the AD to provide the most simple means to ensure compliance with both Air Tractor's recommendations and the Airworthiness Directive.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>If the airplane is new or has not previously complied with SL347 and AD 2021-05-14, within 300 ±4 5 hours you must perform a dye penetrant inspection of each flap torque tube actuator attachment bracket.</li>
    <li>After the first dye penetrant inspection, the attachment brackets must be visually inspected every 300 ± 45 hours.</li>
    <li>After the first dye penetrant inspection, the attachment brackets must be dye penetrant inspected every 900 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:  If you aircraft is new, review the logbook.  It is likely that the initial dye penetrant inspection was performed when the original torque tube was installed.</p>


<p><b>300 Hour Inspection Procedure</b></p>
<p>This procedure is taken from SL347 and is provided here for convenience.</p>
<p>Differences between AD compliance requirements and the recommendations in SL347 are noted.</p>
<p>To comply with SL347 Section 4(A) and AD 2015-05-14 Section (g)(2):</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>
        4(A)(1) Remove the side skins adjacent to the cockpit as necessary to gain access to the 
        flap torque tube.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(A)(2) Before inspecting the torque tube welds, inspect the general condition of the flap 
        control system. Make sure that the system is operating properly and that the flap 
        travel is correct. See Owners Manual for travel limits and tolerances. Make sure 
        that there is no binding or rubbing in the system. Pay special attention to the 
        right and left flap control arm push rod attach bolts ensuring that they pass the 
        inboard wing skins without rubbing or hanging up.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(A)(3) Clean the welds to remove dirt and debris that would interfere with the 
        inspection. Using a light and mirror, visually inspect the flap actuator attach plate
        welds for cracks. Use FAA AC 43.13 Chapter 5 Section 2 “Visual Inspections” to 
        accomplish the visual inspection.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(A)(4) If cracks are found, remove and replace the flap torque tube.
        Note:  The replacement torque tube does not necessarily need to be 0 TIS as long as it has successfully completed the 900-hour dye penetrant inspection per this Section and SL347 Section 4(B).  Reference AD 2015-05-14, Section (g)(2).
    </li>
    <li>
        4(A)(5) Record in the airframe logbooks the results of this inspection and that it was 
        performed “per SL 347 Rev. A”.
    </li>
</ol>

<p><b>900 Hour Inspection Procedure</b></p>
<p>This procedure is taken from SL347 and is provided here for convenience.</p>
<p>Differences between AD compliance requirements and the recommendations in SL347 are noted.</p>
<p>To comply with SL347 Section 4(B) and AD 2015-05-14 Section (g)(1):</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>
        4(B)(1) Complete steps 4(A)(1) and 4(A)(2) from above.
        Note:  AD 2015-05-14 does not require this step to be completed however Air Tractor recommends you remove the side skins because doing so makes it is much easier to access the flap torque tube.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(2)  It is necessary to remove the flap torque tube from the aircraft to complete the 
        dye penetrant inspection. Depending on airplane configuration, remove any 
        components necessary to gain access to the torque tube.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(3) To remove the torque tube, remove the flap actuator as instructed in the Owners 
        Manual Maintenance Section. Remove the two flap control push rods and arms 
        from the ends of the torque tube. Remove the limit micro switch actuating arm.  
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(4) Remove the cable tensioner push rod. (AT-802, AT-802A only)
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(5) Remove the bolts that attach the torque tube to the links in the aileron control 
        system. AT-802 and AT-802A do not have these.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(6) Remove the bolts that attach the torque tube to the lower longeron on both sides 
        and remove the torque tube from the plane.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(7) Perform a dye penetrant inspection using the methods detailed in FAA Advisory 
        Circular 43.13 Chapter 5 Section 5 “Penetrant Inspection”. The paint must be 
        removed from the weld area prior to performing the penetrant inspection. Dye 
        Penetrant Types I, II, or III may be used for this inspection, but note that some 
        penetrant types are not compatible with others (See FAA Special Airworthiness 
        Bulletin (SAIB) CE-18-26).
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(8) If cracks are found in any weld area, the torque tube must be replaced.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(9) If no cracks are found, thoroughly clean all dye penetrant from the torque tube 
        with naphtha, wipe clean, and then blow dry any crevices with compressed air. 
        Repaint the bare metal areas with paint products listed in the Owners Manual. 
        Once dry, reinstall the torque tube and all disturbed parts/systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(10) Inspect the area thoroughly to ensure proper installation and adjustment and 
        perform any functional checks necessary to ensure proper operation of any 
        system that may have been affected by this inspection.   
    </li>
    <li>
        4(B)(11) Record in the airframe logbooks the results of this inspection and that it was 
        performed “per SL 347 Rev. A”. Also record what type of dye penetrant was 
        used in this inspection. (Type I - Fluorescent Dye, Type II - Visible Dye, Type III 
        - Dual Mode Visible and Fluorescent Dye).
        Note:  You may also reference this manual and section and AD 2021-05-14.  Also note that the AD does not require you to note what type of dye penetrant that was used, however, Air Tractor recommends that you do so so that future inspections may be performed successfully.
    </li>
    <li>
        Air Tractor recommends and requests that you report any cracked weld on the flap torque tube to the Customer Service Department.  (940-564-5616)
    </li>
