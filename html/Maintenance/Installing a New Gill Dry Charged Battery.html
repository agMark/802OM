<p>When a new Gill G-246 (G-246AT) battery is installed in the airplane, certain procedures must be observed to ensure
        the satisfactory service of the battery. </p>

<div class="boxCautionMedium">
        <p class="boxCautionMediumHeader">CAUTION</p>
        <p class="boxCautionMediumText">Do not remove seals or vent plugs until ready to fill with electrolyte.</p>
</div>


<p>The procedure for charging the battery is shown below.</p>

<ol type="1">
        <li>Remove seals from cells.</li>

        <li>
                On initial wet down, fill each cell with 1.285 specific gravity sulfuric acid to a level just above the
                separators.
        </li>

        <li>
                Rock battery from side to side to release any trapped air. Readjust electrolyte level as per Step #2
                above.
        </li>

        <li>
                Let battery stand for one hour.
        </li>

        <li>
                Check electrolyte level and readjust if necessary to a level JUST ABOVE THE SEPARATORS (Electrolyte
                level
                will generally expand or rise due to the gassing experienced during the charging process outlined
                below).
        </li>

        <li>
                Install vent plugs tightly into each cell.
        </li>

        <li>
                Prior to charging, clean and neutralize any spilled acid on the battery using a solution of baking soda
                and
                water. Rinse with clean water.
        </li>

        <li>
                Charge battery at an initial charge rate of 3 Amps until all cells are gassing freely and the charge
                voltage
                and specific gravity of electrolytes are constant, or the voltage drops, over three successive readings
                taken at one hour intervals (This procedure may take 18-24 hours with a constant current charger). The
                charge rate is reduced to 1.5 Amps when the cells start gassing. The fully-charged battery's electrolyte
                level should be at the bottom of the split ring with the charger still on.
                <br>
                During the period of charging, the electrolyte temperatures shall be maintained between 60째 F and 110째 F
                (15.6째 C and 43.3째 C).
        </li>

        <li>
                When battery is completely charged, the specific gravity should be greater than 1.275. Readings should
                be
                taken with an aircraft battery hydrometer making sure to take the readings as outlined on the hydrometer
                instructions.
        </li>

        <li>
                After the battery is fully charged, and with the charger still on, adjust electrolyte level to the
                bottom of the split ring and continue to charge for one hour. Clean and neutralize any spilled acid
                prior to
                installing in aircraft.
        </li>
