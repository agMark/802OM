<p><b>ITT</b></p>
<p>
    This section provides instructions for checking the calibration of the ITT indicator for Air Tractor aircraft 
with Pratt & Whitney PT6A turbine engines. These instructions are written for use with a Barfield TT1200 
Turbine Temperature Test Set. Other ITT calibration equipment may be used if that equipment is appropriate 
for use with Air Tractor ITT systems. When other equipment is used, the operator shall follow the 
manufacturer's operating instructions. Ensure that the test equipment has a current calibration before 
performing a calibration check of the engine instrument
</p>

<p>
    The ITT system may be in one of two configurations: with lead resistance or without lead resistance. 
Calibration checking instructions for each style are different. Systems without lead resistance use an electronic 
indicator and are easily recognized by multiple pin connectors on the back of the instrument. These systems 
typically use a 2” instrument and are more common on newer aircraft. Systems with lead resistance have only 
two wires connecting the instrument to the engine. These systems typically use a 3” instrument and are more 
common on older aircraft.
</p>

<p>
    Most aircraft manufactured after mid-2000 have an ITT instrument without lead resistance. These 
systems will not provide a temperature indication unless the indicator is powered with 24 to 28 volts, or normal 
aircraft power. The tester will be set up to simulate the ITT sensors in the engine. The output of the tester will 
be adjusted until the cockpit indicator shows a marked temperature (ex. 600°C). The calibrated temperature 
will then be read from the display of the tester. Use the format of the temperatures from the Sample Test Card 
provided in this section.
</p>

<p>SYSTEMS WITHOUT LEAD RESISTANCE (Power Required)</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Disconnect aircraft power to the instrument. The simplest way to do this is to disengage, or 
        pop out, the 5 amp "Engine Instruments" circuit breaker.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disconnect at least one of the instrument leads from the engine thermocouple terminal block. 
        Note which lead was connected to which terminal.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the TT1200, set the “FUNCTION” switch to “IND TEST.”
    </li>
    <li>
       Set the “RANGE” switch to “20K=0Ω Sys Res.” 
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the “1°C/.1°C” switch to “1°C.”
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the “°C/MV” switch to “°C.”
    </li>
    <li>
        Connect the TT1200 harness to the “TEST” connector on the TT1200 test set.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connect the black clip of the tester to the end of the instrument lead (Red) that was connected 
        to the Alumel (-) terminal on the engine thermocouple block. Connect the red clip to the lead 
        (Yellow) that was connected to the Chromel (+) terminal.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connect aircraft power to the instrument and turn the Master switch ON. Set the “ON/OFF” 
        switch of the TT1200 to “ON”
    </li>
    <li>
        For the calibration check, the operator will need to take readings from the gauge inside of the 
        cockpit as well as at the test set near the engine.
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                Rotate the “TEMP ADJ” knob on the test set so that a temperature of 200°C is indicated 
                on the ITT indicator in the cockpit. Record the temperature off of the TT1200 test set
            </li>
            <li>
                 Repeat this for each temperature shown on the Sample Test Card.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adjust the temperature knob on the test set so that the ITT indicator lines up exactly with 
                the red line. Record the temperature of the line, as well as the temperature indicated on 
                the test set.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, adjust the temperature knob on the test set so that the ITT indicator points at the 
                red triangle. Record the temperature of the red triangle, as well as the temperature 
                indicated on the test set.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once all temperatures are recorded from the TT1200 and the instrument, turn the airplane 
        Master switch OFF, turn the TT1200 OFF, disconnect the test equipment, and return the aircraft 
        to the configuration prior to testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compare the readings from the TT1200 and instrument. See the appropriate table below for 
        tolerances. If the instrument is not within acceptable calibration, send the instrument to a shop 
        for overhaul and calibration.
    </li>
