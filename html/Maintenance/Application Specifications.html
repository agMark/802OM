<p><b>A. Oil Flow Theory</b></p>
<p>-Compressor lubrication occurs as the oil which circulates with the refrigerant passes through the compressor
    crankcase during operation. The Sanden SD series compressor achieves optimal durability and cooling performance when
    oil circulates through the system at a ratio of 3.3% to 8% oil to refrigerant. Excess oil can act as an insulator
    limiting heat transfer in the evaporator and condenser, while too little oil can negatively affect durability. </p>
<p>-Oil will collect in low pressure cool components (evaporator, accumulator and suction hose) of the refrigerant loop.
    For example a long suction hose which sags can collect several ounces thus reducing overall oil circulation ratio.

    <p>B. Oil Changing</p>

<img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
<p>a) For a new compressor to be used in this type of system, subtract the delivered oil amount from the desired total
    oil charge to determine how much oil should be added to the compressor and system. (For total system required oil
    amount, see Section 2C System Requirements). </p>
<p>b)Remove the oil filler plug and charge the compressor with the amount of additional oil determined in step a). Use
    only new oil of the correct type as shown on the compressor label. If calculated amount is greater than 300cc (10oz)
    oil can be added to other system components. </p>
<p>c) Re-install oil plug. Seat and O-ring must be clean and not damaged. Torque to 11-18 ft•lb (15-25 N•m, 150-200
    kgf•cm). </p>
