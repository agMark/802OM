<p>Calibration of the MVP-50T system is done similarly to analog instruments.  The process is somewhat more complicated because it is not possible to remove individual instruments and then send them to a calibration shop.  All testing must therefore be performed with the instruments and devices installed.</p>


<p><b>Pressure Sensors</b></p>
<p>Follow the on-aircraft calibration procedures for pressure sensors provided in the previous section.</p>


<p><b>Tachometers</b></p>
<p>Calibration of NG and NP for aircraft equipped with MVP-50T requires that you perform the on-aircraft testing described in the previous section.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is permissible to send the tach generators to a shop for calibration while also checking that the MVP indicates the correct value within 20RPM (for NP) or .2% (NG) using a calibrated tach generator emulator.  If this is done, both the generators and the MVP indicator will be verified to report accurately and the system can be considered to have been calibrated.</p>

<p><b>G-Meter</b></p>
<p>If installed, the G-Meter should be observed to determine if it is reporting accurate information.</p>

<p>The inaccuracy is evident because the G-force sensor’s reading is not either 0.9 or 1.0 when the airplane is stationary. To correct the inaccuracy, it will be necessary to perform a G-force sensor calibration procedure, to adjust the sensor’s Gain and Offset. If sensor calibration is required, refer to Service Letter #354.</p>
