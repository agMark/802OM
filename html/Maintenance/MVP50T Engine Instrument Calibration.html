<p>Calibration of the MVP-50T system is done with a generally similar process as compared to analog instruments.  The process is somewhat more complicated because it is not possible to remove individual instruments and then send them to a calibration shop.  All testing must therefore be performed with the instruments and devices in SITU.</p>


<p><b>Pressure Sensors</b></p>
<p>Torque, oil pressure, and fuel pressure indications are provided by pressure transducers that are mounted on the forward portion of the firewall.</p>
<p></p>


<p><b>Tachometers</b></p>
<p>Calibration of the NP and NG tachometers are complicated because it is difficult to provide a known good reference</p>

<p><b>ITT</b></p>
ITT should be checked with a type K thermocouple tester.  In the industry, these are commonly referred to as "Barfield" testers.  

<p><b>Oil Temperature</b></p>

<p><b>Fuel Flow</b></p>


<p><b>Air Filter Indicator</b></p>

<p><b>Beta Light</b></p>
<p>The beta light is a discrete signal from the beta and prop governor switches, there is no calibration required but it is advisable to observe that the indicator is functioning properly during ground operations.</p>

<p><b>Chip Detectors</b></p>

<p><b>Fuel Filter Indicator</b></p>

<p><b>Outside Air Temperature</b></p>
The outside air temperature probe is located underneath the right hand wing.  To check this function, it is recommended that the probe is dipped into an ice bath and a hot water bath.  Compare the OAT indication 

<p><b>Amps</b></p>
<p>Generator electrical current is measured using a shunt resistor which is mounted with the main relays.</p>
<p>There is no need to calibrate this function unless there is a suspicion that it is providing erroneous information</p>
<p>The shunt resistor is designed to produce a 50mV voltage drop when 300 amps of current flow through it.  To check that the shunt, measure the resistance between the screw terminals.  The resistance should be .16mΩ.</p>

<p><b>G-Meter</b></p>
<p>Aircraft that have the MVP-50T Primary Engine Monitor STC installed by Air Tractor (SA02135SE) may have a G-force sensor, labeled GS-3, not reading accurately. As of September 2016, a G-force calibration inspection requirement was been added to Air Tractor production. 
</p>
<p>The inaccuracy is evident because the G-force sensor’s reading is not either 0.9 or 1.0 when the airplane is stationary. To correct the inaccuracy, it will be necessary to perform a G-force sensor calibration procedure, to adjust the sensor’s Gain and Offset. If sensor calibration is required, refer to Service Letter #354.</p>
<p>Air Tractor aircraft have received approval from the FAA to disable the MVP-50T’s master caution and master warning lights from being triggered by propeller RPM (NP) for Models which have one or more yellow ranges on the NP display. Those yellow NP ranges are intended to remind the pilot that stabilized ground operations are restricted within those ranges, according to AFM guidance. However, the yellow NP ranges are not restricted during any in-flight condition, and it is common for some Air Tractor models to operate in flight within a yellow NP range for extended periods of time. Therefore, disabling the MVP-50T master caution and master warning lights for NP will eliminate a nuisance caution light from coming on in flight, or from coming on when advancing the throttle during takeoff.
