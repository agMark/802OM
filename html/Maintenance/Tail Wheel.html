<p>The tail wheel is a Cleveland p/n 40-14003. Keeping the bearings properly lubricated is the key to long bearing life. A grease fitting is installed in the side of the wheel. Details of the tail wheel are shown in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_77.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. </p>

<p>To remove the tail wheel, jack the wheel clear of the ground per Section <xref sectionTarget="2.0.4" prependLabel="Section">.</xref> and remove the long AN7C84A bolt that attaches the axle to the fork. Note the method of safety wire on the large stainless jam nut and cut the wire loose from the fork. The tail wheel is now free and ready for disassembly. Back off the jam nut from the axle and remove the axle. Inspect the axle for wear at the bearing positions, as insufficient greasing procedures will cause the bearing to turn on the axle and ruin both parts. Inspect the AN7 bolt for wear and straightness, and slide the bolt through the fork to check the hole in the fork for wear. There should be no wear in the fork holes since there is no movement between fork and bolt. If the tire is to be removed, deflate and remove the bolts holding the wheel halves together. </p>

<p>There have been two reports of broken AT-802 tail wheel axle bolts. This is the AN7C84A bolt that passes through the tail wheel axle. If broken, this bolt could cause loss of directional control on the ground.</p>

<p>The broken bolts were from the same manufacturer’s lot of bolts and were received in the 2008-2012 timeframe. It is recommended that all tail wheel axle bolts from this lot be replaced. The bolts are identified with the letters “HPF” on the face of the bolt head.</p>

<p>Clean all parts and re-assemble. Partial inflate the tube to keep from pinching it. </p>

<p> Air Tractor is now manufacturing an all-aluminum tail wheel, part number 40260-1 as an option to all other Air Tractor approved tail wheels. All-aluminum tail wheels have proven to be more resistant to chemicals used in aerial application as compared to the original magnesium ones.</p>

<p>Tail wheel bearings are Timken 13889 cone (the part with the rollers) and 13836CP cup (the part pressed into the wheel half). Hand pack the bearings with grease, MIL-G-81322, and install wheel on the axle. Install the 40139-1 jam nut and 40138-1 tongue washer on the axle with the round shoulder inboard and tighten until all bearing slack is removed but the wheel is free to turn. Inflate the tire to 60 psi. Grease the axle bolt and install wheel and axle assembly on the fork. Torque the nut to 550 inch-pounds. Safety the jam nut against the rotation of the wheel with MS20995C32 stainless safety wire. </p>

<p>Along with the new tail wheel, a new axle is being introduced, part number 40134-5. A grease fitting is installed in the axle that allows for purge lubrication of the tail wheel bearings. </p>
