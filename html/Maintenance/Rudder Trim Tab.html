<p>The rudder trim tab is also used as a boot tab to reduce pedal forces in normal flight. The tab is made of a single skin wrapped around a welded-spar-and-rib frame. The tab is controlled by a single control arm on its right-hand side. This arm has threaded 10-32 studs both sides to attach the two control rods. The tab installation is shown below.</p>

<p>The tab is held in place by two studs that fits loosely into pre-oiled porous-bronze bearings in each end of the tab spar. The upper stud is fixed to the rudder and the lower stud is attached to the end of a metal strap that is itself bolted to the bottom-aft of the rudder. </p>

<p>The tab may be removed by first removing the AN365-1032 nuts that retain the control rods. The control rods can now be disconnected. The tab can be separated from the rudder by removing the two AN3 bolts that fasten the strap and stud to the bottom of the rudder. The lower stud can be pulled free and the tab can be removed. </p>
