    <p><b>Operational Check</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Drain all fuel from aircraft.</li>
        <li>Warning light should be illuminated.</li>
        <li>Add 3 gallons of fuel to each wing tank. This is the unusable / ungageable fuel.</li>
        <li>Add 10 gallons of fuel to each wing tank in 5 gallon increments.</li>
        <li>Observe when warning light extinguishes. Light should extinguish when 16 Â± 4 gallons of fuel have been
            added.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Troubleshooting</b></p>
    <p>The most common cause of a low fuel warning system malfunction is a stuck or inoperative float sensor, however, a general condition check of the entire system to should be performed as follows:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Drain all fuel from aircraft.</li>
        <li>Verify functionality of the light using the push-to-test feature.</li>
        <li>Inspect wiring from light to sensors which are mounted on the most inboard rib.</li>
        <li>Check that pin 1 on the indicator light is powered by the power bus and the "AIR/BETA/FUEL PRESS" circuit breaker.</li>
        <li>Check that the sensors are grounded to the airframe.  The ground wire runs from the sensor to the 10559 skin support.</li>
        <li>Manually operate each sensor to isolate which one is malfunctioning.  (Only one switch must be closed to illuminate the light, it will be helpful to hold one in the up or OFF position while exercising the other)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the issue is identified, the troubleshooting procedure may be terminated.  Perform to the operational check to ensure that the system is operating properly.</p>
