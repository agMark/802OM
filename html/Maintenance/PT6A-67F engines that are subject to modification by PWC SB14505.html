<p>AT-802 2-seat aircraft prior to S/N 802-0602/802-4030 that are equipped with PT6A-67F engines are subject to modification by P&WC SB14505. </p>
<p>P&WC has discovered that oil can migrate into the compressor Bleed Valve (BOV) via an internal Px air passage. This may require replacement of the BOV with one that has an external line routing air from the P3 cabin bleed port. This new external line creates an interference with the ballast weight and an engine ground wire attached to the engine mount ring. A new ballast weight, mounting brackets, and ground wire have created to alleviate this interference. Refer to Service Letter #336 for further information.</p>
