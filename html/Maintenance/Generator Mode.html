<p>Following engine starting and prior to turning the Generator Switch ON (The engine at ground idle) the voltage output of the S/G (Terminal B) should be .5 to 1.5 volts. This is a residual voltage that results from residual magnetism in the S/G even though the field excitation from the GCU is zero. Turning the Generator Switch ON causes this residual voltage to be applied to pin J, which the GCU in turn outputs on pin M. As a result the S/G output will build up rapidly and stabilize at the 27.5 Volt setting of the GCU (externally adjusted from 26.5 to 28.5 volts). Sensing for Voltage Regulation is between pins B and G. </p>
