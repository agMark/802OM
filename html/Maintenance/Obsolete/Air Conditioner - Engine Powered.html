<p>The Air Tractor engine-powered air conditioner uses a Sanden 508 compressor with a serpentine type pulley and electromagnetic clutch. A splined shaft in the compressor-mount casting engages a drive gear in the accessory case of the engine. This quill shaft (p/n 51628) has a small diameter shear section that protects the engine in case of a compressor or bearing failure. This pulley drives the compressor's flywheel by the use of a pair of matched V-belts. The splined shaft, small pulley, belts, and compressor flywheel are engaged and moving any time that the compressor section of the engine is turning. </p>

<p>The clutch is engaged any time that the air-conditioner switch is on and the system pressure is within operating limits. High pressure causes the over-pressure contacts in the trinary switch to open. This opening breaks the circuit to the clutch and it is de-energized. The trinary switch also has a low-pressure circuit that breaks the circuit to the clutch in the event that sufficient refrigerant is lost from the system to cause damage to the compressor. </p>

<p>The condenser is a copper-core, single pass, 12-inch-by 24-inch coil. Refrigerant enters the top of the coil and exits at its lower side. Air for cooling the condenser is drawn in through louvers in the left side of the aft fuselage. This cooling air moves athwart ship to the dual pusher-type fans that drive it through the condenser coil and out through the louvers in the right-hand side of the aft fuselage. </p>

<p>The receiver-dryer is suitable for use with either refrigerant R-12 or R-134a. However, the receiver-dryer must be replaced if a change is made from one refrigerant to the other. </p>

<p>The expansion valve is a block type with internal temperature and pressure compensation. </p>

<p>The evaporator uses a multi-pass coil and a squirrel-cage blower. A ram-air selector on the aft-cabin wall allows the input of outside air for mixing with cabin air while the air conditioner is in use. </p>

<p>All hoses in the system are Teflon-sheathed to minimize transpiration leakage of the refrigerant. The hoses are mated to their end-fittings with bubble-crimp swages. All of the end-fitting connections are made with O-ring and Tube connectors. </p>

<p>The service valves are close together inside the first removable skin behind the cockpit on the right-hand side of the airplane. </p>
