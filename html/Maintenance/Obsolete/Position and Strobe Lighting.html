<p>The wiring schematic for the position lights and the strobe lights is shown in Figure 40. These lights are controlled by the navigation-light switch on the lower instrument panel. When the switch is placed in the DOWN position, power is sent to the red light on the left-hand wing tip, the green light on the right-hand wing tip, and the white light on the rudder. When the switch is placed in the UP position, power is sent to the three position lights plus the strobe lights located on each wing tip.</p>
