=<p>The wiring schematic for the wing flaps is shown in Figure 28. Power to drive the flaps up and down is provided by two relays, with one relay for each direction of travel. Each of the UP or DOWN relays is actuated by placing the cockpit flap switch in the appropriate location. The wiring from the flap switch to the relays is routed through the micro-switches that serve as limit switches for the full UP and full DOWN positions. </p>
