<p>The instrument lights are dimmed by two separate dimmer controls. One of these is for the upper panel instrument lights and the other is for the lower panel lights. The instrument light switch feeds power to the dimmer circuits and the flap light through the five Amp instrument-light circuit breaker. The pilot has control of the instrument light intensity through the knob on the variable resistor, P/N RV4NAYSD-102A, mounted in the upper panel. There is a separate control for each of the upper panel and the lower panel lights. The controls for the upper and lower panels are identical except for wire numbers. The variable resistor controls the bias on the base pin of the P/N 2N3055 power transistor. Power is fed to the collector of the transistor while the emitter of the transistor outputs current to the lighting bus. The schematic of the dimmer circuit is shown on drawing 60059 page 2, and the assembly details are shown on the drawing 60647. </p>
