<p> The belt for the air conditioning system must be tightened correctly. The belt is held in place using a belt-tension turnbuckle and is secured with safety wire, as seen in <xref fileTarget="img_BeltTensioning.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below. Before tightening the turnbuckle, verify that the drive pulleys are properly aligned. If they are not, loosen the set screw in the small pulley on the compressor drive and adjust the small pulley to align the two. Once aligned, tighten the set screw. </p>

<p> If using a Deco tensiometer or equivalent, rotate the turnbuckle to tighten the belt to 10 lbs. </p>

<p> If a tensiometer is unavailable, rotate the turnbuckle slowly until the belt is in tension. Place a straight edge along the flat of the installed belt. Apply a force of 3 lbs at the center of the flat section of the belt. With a three pound force applied, you should measure a 0.10 in. deflection between the straight edge and the belt at the force application point, as seen in <xref fileTarget="img_BeltTensioningByHand.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below.  If the belt deflects more than 0.1 inch, continue to rotate the turnbuckle until there is only a 0.1 inch deflection.</p>

<p> Once the belt is tensioned, attach safety wire to the turnbuckle and torque the hardware. </p>
