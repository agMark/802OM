    The air conditioner drive pad overhaul involves replacement of bearings, seals and worn components.  Exact procedures and parts needed depend on the particular drive pad assembly and the wear that is observed.  These procedures are derived from SL170.
</p>

<p>These procedures assume that the drive pad assembly has been removed from the engine.</p>

<p><b>Procedure:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Remove quill shaft.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the pulley end seal and retaining ring.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set casting up in a press with the pulley end down.  Use a 4 to 6 inch small diameter rod (approximately 3/8") inserted in the quill shaft end of the pulley shaft to press the shaft and bearing out of the casting.  Warming up the assembly will aid removal as aluminum expands faster than steel.  Do not exceed 230°F.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the engine end seal inside the casting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the external retaining ring on the engine side of the pulley shaft.  
    </li>
    <li>
        Press the bearings off the shaft.
    </li>
    <li>
        Replace all bearings, seals and retaining rings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reverse the previous procedures to reassemble.  Refer to

        When installing the pulley shaft in the housing, it is advisable to first cool the shaft and bearings in a freezer while warming the casting to approximately 200°F.  Be sure to seat the outer race of the engine side bearing against the bottom of the casting bore.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect the assembly.  The shaft should turn smoothly by hand with no rough or tight spots.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is advisable but not required to replace the quill shaft.  A worn or damaged quill shaft requires removal.  
    </li>
    <li>
        For dry spline installation, grease quill shaft with high temperature molybdenum grease.  For all others, lightly lubricate with turbine engine oil.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reinstall quill shaft into pulley shaft and install new retaining ring.  For sealed drive pad types, install a new o-ring onto quill shaft.
    </li>
