<p>The wiring schematic for the cockpit lighting is shown in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_40.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross
        Reference</xref>. The intensity level of the cockpit lights, except for the dome and map lights, is controlled
    by the solid-state dimming circuit. </p>

<p>When the panel light switch is turned ON, power is available to the dimming circuit. The panel-light intensity is
    controlled by the panel-light rheostat on the instrument panel. </p>


<p><b>Troubleshooting</b></p>

<p>The following instructions are for the upper panel dimmer circuit. Troubleshooting the lower panel is identical
    except that on later aircraft the wires are numbered differently from the upper panel control to the lower panel
    control. Use the schematic, drawing 60059 page 2, and the assembly drawing, 60647, to aid in troubleshooting. </p>

<p>If one of the electronic dimmers should fail to operate, first check the five-Amp-instrument-light circuit breaker.
    If the flap light burns when the master switch and the instrument light switches are activated, the circuit breaker
    and switch are good. Open the lower panel and visually inspect the wiring harness for broken wires and corroded
    connections. </p>

<p>To check for a short in the instrument light fixtures, make sure the master switch is OFF and disconnect the
    60302-114 transistor output wire from the lighting bus. Fabricate a test lead with a five-Amp circuit breaker, two
    alligator clips, and about 18 inches of 20-gauge wire. Make sure that the instrument lights work by connecting the
    test lead, with the circuit breaker in line, between the power bus and the lighting bus. Turn ON the master switch.
    If the lights illuminate, the fixtures and wiring are fine. If the circuit breaker in the test lead pops, there is a
    short in the instrument light fixtures or wiring. If there is a short, isolate it and make the necessary repairs.
    Make sure all of the lights and wiring of the system are working before proceeding, since shorts are the most common
    cause of transistor failure. </p>

<p>Once it is known that the instrument lights and wiring are good, and the dimmer still will not control them, use a
    Volt meter to make sure that the instrument-light switch is feeding bus voltage to the variable resistor and the C
    terminal of the transistor. To access the terminals of the transistor, remove the two screws that hold the heat sink
    to the lower panel. The variable-resistor terminal with the 60302-167 wire is the power wire from the instrument
    light switch. If voltage is not present at either one or both of these terminals, isolate the trouble and make the
    necessary repairs to the wiring. Use the Volt meter to check the voltage at the B terminal of the transistor. This
    voltage should vary from 0 to bus level when the control knob is turned. </p>

<p>
    If the voltage is not proper at the B terminal, remove the transistor and recheck the voltage at the B terminal of
    the transistor socket. To remove the transistor from the socket, remove the two screws holding it to the heat sink.
    Pull the transistor out of the socket. If the voltage is still not proper at the B terminal, the variable resistor
    (P/N RV4NAYSD-102A) is bad or has a bad ground. If the voltages to the B and C terminal of the transistor are good
    and the dimmer does not work, the transistor is bad. To install a new transistor (P/N 2N3055), coat the bottom of
    the transistor with a thin coat of heat-sink compound. Insert the mica insulator over the two transistor leads and
    stick it to the heat-sink compound (thermal paste). Coat the bottom of the mica insulator with a thin coat of heat-sink compound.
    Plug the transistor through the heat sink and into the socket. Install the screws
    that were removed. Make sure that the shoulders of the transistor-socket-screw holes seat properly in the heat-sink
    holes. The case of the transistor is one of the electrical connections of the transistor, and must not be grounded
    to the heat sink or the aircraft. If the case is shorted to ground, with the power on, the transistor will be
    ruined. Once the wires have been reconnected and the unit is working properly, mount the heat sink to the lower
    panel and secure any loose wires as necessary. Double check the operation of the unit before fastening the lower
    panel and returning the aircraft to service.
