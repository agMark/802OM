<b>Commercial Aircraft Products C100168-4 Actuator:</b>

<p>The actuator assembly has a threaded collar. This collar is threaded internally to match the threads on the worm
       drive threads of the actuator, and it is threaded externally to match the threads of the Air Tractor Tee
       assembly, which is p/n 70037-1. The Tee assembly is attached to the two 1/4” thick aluminum 70581-1 arm
       assemblies that are bolted to the flap torque tube assembly. The Tee assembly has a steel grease shield and cap
       attached. The shield is p/n 70039-2 and is attached to the Tee with two AN500A5-3 screws. Be sure the lock
       washers are under the head of the AN500A5-3 screws. The cap is a 1 1/8 SC Caplug attached to the shield with a
       TY-525 Tyrap. </p>

<p>The Tee assembly that screws into the Threaded collar has a AN5675 D6H4 set screw that is located on the top surface
       of the Tee. The threaded collar has a large diameter rounded surface and just forward is a smaller diameter part
       on the collar that is to be used for tightening the collar against the Tee. Whenever it is necessary to remove
       the flap actuator, the factory practice is to be first loosen the set screw in the Tee assembly with a small
       Allen wrench, then place a soft rag or duct tape on the small diameter of the threaded collar so as not to
       scratch the finish and with a pair of water-pump pliers or vise-grips, break loose the connection between the
       threaded collar and the Tee assembly. Then the threaded collar can be screwed by hand from the Tee. Be careful
       not to dent or scratch the finish of the ball nut as small dents will interfere with the action of the balls
       inside.</p>

<b>Air Tractor 71112-1 Actuator: </b>

<p>The actuator assembly attaches to the fuselage frame via a clamp. The actuator is attached to this clamp with an
       AN4-14A bolt. At this connection there is also a 70026-3 spacer bushing and a Bunting P37-8 bronze bushing. If
       the actuator is replaced or removed, be sure both bushings are in place.</p>

<p>The actuator assembly has a 1-inch diameter ball screw shaft. A ball nut moves along this shaft. The 71149-1 yoke
       (tee) assembly is fitted on the ball nut and held in place with the 71152-1 yoke nut assembly. This yoke nut
       includes a steel grease shield and is secured on the ball nut with two 90289A338 set screws. The yoke assembly is
       attached to two 1/4” thick aluminum 70032-1 arm assemblies that are bolted with four AN4-7A bolts to the flap
       torque tube assembly. See Figures 27A and 27B. </p>

       <p class='boxCautionLargeHeader'>CAUTION</p>
       <p class='boxCautionLargeText'>Have someone hold up on the flap trailing edge so the flaps will not fall down
              against the boom hangers.</p>

<p>See the section on FLAP ACTUATOR TROUBLESHOOTING for a step-by-step procedure for removing the actuator assembly from
       the aircraft. </p>
<p>All wires from the flap actuator assembly have Wristlock connections so that it is not necessary to cut or splice
       wires when the actuator is removed. Also, it is possible to replace the motor without removing the actuator
       assembly. </p>
