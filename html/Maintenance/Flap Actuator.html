<p>The actuator assembly has a threaded collar. This collar is threaded internally to match the threads on the worm
  drive threads of the actuator, and it is threaded externally to match the threads of the Air Tractor Tee
  assembly, which is p/n 70037-1. The Tee assembly is attached to the two 1/4" thick aluminum 70581-1 arm
  assemblies that are bolted to the flap torque tube assembly. The Tee assembly has a steel grease shield and cap
  attached. The shield is p/n 70039-2 and is attached to the Tee with two AN500A5-3 screws. Be sure the lock
  washers are under the head of the AN500A5-3 screws. The cap is a 1 1/8 SC Caplug attached to the shield with a
  TY-525 Tyrap. </p>

<p>The Tee assembly that screws into the Threaded collar has a AN5675 D6H4 set screw that is located on the top surface
  of the Tee. The threaded collar has a large diameter rounded surface and just forward is a smaller diameter part
  on the collar that is to be used for tightening the collar against the Tee. Whenever it is necessary to remove
  the flap actuator, the factory practice is to be first loosen the set screw in the Tee assembly with a small
  Allen wrench, then place a soft rag or duct tape on the small diameter of the threaded collar so as not to
  scratch the finish and with a pair of water-pump pliers or vise-grips, break loose the connection between the
  threaded collar and the Tee assembly. Then the threaded collar can be screwed by hand from the Tee. Be careful
  not to dent or scratch the finish of the ball nut as small dents will interfere with the action of the balls
  inside.</p>
