<b>Commercial Aircraft Products C100168-4 Actuator:</b>

<p>The actuator assembly has a threaded collar. This collar is threaded internally to match the threads on the worm
  drive threads of the actuator, and it is threaded externally to match the threads of the Air Tractor Tee
  assembly, which is p/n 70037-1. The Tee assembly is attached to the two 1/4" thick aluminum 70581-1 arm
  assemblies that are bolted to the flap torque tube assembly. The Tee assembly has a steel grease shield and cap
  attached. The shield is p/n 70039-2 and is attached to the Tee with two AN500A5-3 screws. Be sure the lock
  washers are under the head of the AN500A5-3 screws. The cap is a 1 1/8 SC Caplug attached to the shield with a
  TY-525 Tyrap. </p>

<p>The Tee assembly that screws into the Threaded collar has a AN5675 D6H4 set screw that is located on the top surface
  of the Tee. The threaded collar has a large diameter rounded surface and just forward is a smaller diameter part
  on the collar that is to be used for tightening the collar against the Tee. Whenever it is necessary to remove
  the flap actuator, the factory practice is to be first loosen the set screw in the Tee assembly with a small
  Allen wrench, then place a soft rag or duct tape on the small diameter of the threaded collar so as not to
  scratch the finish and with a pair of water-pump pliers or vise-grips, break loose the connection between the
  threaded collar and the Tee assembly. Then the threaded collar can be screwed by hand from the Tee. Be careful
  not to dent or scratch the finish of the ball nut as small dents will interfere with the action of the balls
  inside.</p>

<b>Air Tractor 71112-1 Actuator</b>

<p>The actuator assembly attaches to the fuselage frame via a clamp. The actuator is attached to this clamp with an
  AN4-14A bolt. At this connection there is also a 70026-3 spacer bushing and a Bunting P37-8 bronze bushing. If
  the actuator is replaced or removed, be sure both bushings are in place.</p>

<p>The actuator assembly has a 1-inch diameter ball screw shaft. A ball nut moves along this shaft. The 71149-1 yoke
  (tee) assembly is fitted on the ball nut and held in place with the 71152-1 yoke nut assembly. This yoke nut
  includes a steel grease shield and is secured on the ball nut with two 90289A338 set screws. The yoke assembly is
  attached to two 1/4" thick aluminum 70032-1 arm assemblies that are bolted with four AN4-7A bolts to the flap
  torque tube assembly. See <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_27B.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>, <xref

<b>Air Tractor 71112-1 Flap Actuator Overhaul</b>

<p>The flap actuator should be replaced or overhauled after 1500 hours of service to assure trouble free operation. If
  it is to be overhauled order a kit of parts from your dealer. The Overhaul kit p/n is 71112-1-500 and consists of
  the following parts: </p>

<p>The 71112-1 flap actuator should be replaced or overhauled at the factory or in a factory approved facility after
  1500 hours of service to assure trouble free operation. If the actuator stops functioning, first check to ensure that
  there is no binding or seized parts in the entire flap system. Also, ensure the limit switches are functioning and set
  properly. </p>

<p>Second, inspect the gearbox for correct operation. To do this, first remove the flap motor from the actuator gearbox
  by removing two nuts from the end of the motor closest to the actuator gearbox. Then turn the gearbox input shaft by
  hand and ensure that the gearbox and the ballscrew shaft turns without binding or roughness. If there is any binding
  or roughness, then the gearbox needs to be replaced or factory-overhauled. </p>

<p>Next, check the motor for proper operation by having someone operate the flap switch in the cockpit. Try the switch
  in both directions (Note that if the flaps are in the full up or full down position, the motor will not turn in both
  directions because a limit switch will be depressed). </p>

<p>If it is determined that the motor is not functioning properly, remove and inspect the spring loaded motor brushes
  for excessive wear. Excessive wear is defined as a brush that has worn down to a length of 1/8" or less. If this is
  the case, P/N 03-057 replacement brushes can be purchased from your dealer (2 required for each motor). For a
  replacement motor, order P/N 90-1026 from your dealer. </p>

<b>Air Tractor 71112-1 Flap Actuator Overhaul Steps</b>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Save and reuse all hardware unless otherwise specified. </li>
  <li>Remove and inspect the 90-1026 flap motor. Replace on condition. Replace the motor brushes with P/N 03-057
    replacement brushes from Specialty Motors. </li>
  <li>Inspect flap actuator attach arms (Item 12 on Dwg 71112). Replace on condition.</li>
  <li>Remove 4 screws and endcap from gearbox. Drain gearbox oil through a strainer. Check for metal particles.
    Specifically check for brass particles that might indicate excessive worm gear wear. </li>
  <li>Remove 8 screws and carefully remove the 71147-1 actuator shaft form the gearbox. Remove the cotter pin and bolt
    from the end of the shaft and remove all parts from the shaft (when removing the ball screw; thread it off of the
    shaft and onto a cardboard shipping tube to prevent the loss of the ball bearings). Discard the ball bearing
    (PS3KDD), the roller bearing (00050 and 00150), and the seal (7410), and the O-Ring MS35333-39). Clean and inspect
    the remaining parts.</li>
  <li>Check the 71118-1 worm gear for any gouging or excessive wear on the teeth. Check the 71154-1 bronze bearing for
    excessive wear (excessive wear is defined as the bearing being thinner than .040" at the center.) Check the 71117-1
    ballscrew shaft dimensions. Replace all discarded parts with new parts to accurately set the shaft dimensions.
    Inspect.</li>
  <li>Rebuild the 71147-1 actuator shaft per Drawing 71147. Use the T71147-1 and T71147-2 tooling to accurately set the
    shaft dimensions. Replace all discarded parts with new parts. Inspect. </li>
  <li>Remove the half of the 71130-1 spider coupling that is attached to the worm shaft. Inspect all three pieces of the
    spider coupling and replace any unserviceable parts. Using the SK655-1 seal pulling tool, remove and discard the
    CR3725 seal from the gearbox. Remove and discard the WHM-87 retaining ring. Remove the worm shaft from the gearbox.
    Remove all parts from the shaft. Discard the cotter pin (MS24665-132) and bearings (PS3KDD and RA4Z). Clean and
    inspect the remaining parts. Check the GLUH worm for any gouging or excessive wear. Discard unserviceable parts.
  </li>
  <li>Rebuild the 71148-1 worm shaft per Drawing 71148, replacing all discarded parts with new parts. Inspect.</li>
  <li>Inspect the 71125-1 gearbox and P37-8 bushing for serviceability. Discard and replace unserviceable parts.</li>
  <li>Rebuild the actuator per Drawing 71112, replacing all discarded parts with new parts.</li>
