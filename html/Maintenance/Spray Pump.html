<p>The spray pump is an Agrinautics p/n 65715 attached to an Agrinautics p/n 60130 strut assembly with AN5-12A bolts. </p>

<p>The standard fan is the Micronair AT-4300 five-blade fan, which is used for low-to-moderate spray volume. For high-volume applications, install the Arrowprop A2-AT4T34 four-blade fan or the Weathaero FA100 fan. Add 48 nozzles to spray booms and change the spray tips on the spray nozzles to larger ones. <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_63.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below shows some typical spray configurations, as well as a chart of available flat fan spray tips. <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_63.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> shows the orifice size and flow rate of the various tips at common spray pressures. </p>

<p>We supply the aircraft with Spraying Systems QU-4010 spray tips pointed 10° down from straight back. These fan tips, with a 40° fan spray angle, oriented this way provide excellent deposition with minimal drift. Additional information on recommended spray pressures and droplet size is available from the factory. </p>

<p>The procedure for removing the spray pump follows: </p>

    <ol type="1">
         <li>Remove fan pitch-control cable or brake-control cable. </li>
         <li>Loosen the hose coupling that secures the pump inlet line to the pump.</li>
         <li>Loosen the hose coupling that secures the pump outlet port to the spray valve line.</li>
         <li>Release the latches on the Agrinautics strut assembly and remove the pump and fan.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>or</p>
    <ol type="1">
       <li>Remove the strut through-bolt on the alternate configuration and remove the pump and fan.</li>
    </ol>

<p>The pump may be replaced by reversing the order of removal shown above. </p>
