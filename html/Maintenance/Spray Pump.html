<p>The spray pump is an Agrinautics p/n 65715 attached to an Agrinautics p/n 60130 strut assembly with AN5-12A bolts. </p>

<p>The standard fan is the Micronair AT-4300 five-blade fan, which is used for low-to-moderate spray volume. For high-volume applications, install the Arrowprop A2-AT4T34 four-blade fan or the Weathaero FA100 fan. Add 48 nozzles to spray booms and change the spray tips on the spray nozzles to larger ones. Figure 63 shows some typical spray configurations. Figure 63 also shows a chart of available flat fan spray tips. This chart shows the orifice size and flow rate of the various tips at common spray pressures. </p>

<p>We supply the aircraft with Spraying Systems QU-4010 spray tips pointed 10° down from straight back. These fan tips, with a 40° fan spray angle, oriented this way provide excellent deposition with minimal drift. Additional information on recommended spray pressures and droplet size is available from the factory. </p>

<p>The procedure for removing the spray pump follows: </p>

    <ol type="1">
         <li>Remove fan pitch-control cable or brake-control cable. </li>
         <li>Loosen the hose coupling that secures the pump inlet line to the pump.</li>
         <li>Loosen the hose coupling that secures the pump outlet port to the spray valve line.</li>
         <li>Release the latches on the Agrinautics strut assembly and remove the pump and fan.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>Remove the strut through-bolt on the alternate configuration and remove the pump and fan. </p>

<p>The pump may be replaced by reversing the order of removal shown above. </p>
