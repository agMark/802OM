<p>The fuel tanks are sealed with PRC 890A-1 or PR-1422 A2, which are brushed on, and PRC 890B-2 or PR-1422 B2, which is thicker putty-like material for sealing corners or large cracks. Sealing between mating parts is done during assembly, and final coating is done through the nine inspection openings in the top of the tank.</p>

<p><b>Acceptable Leaks (until able to be repaired)</b></p>
<p>
    It is permissible to operate your turbine powered Air Tractor with small leaks in the integral wing tanks.  Small leaks are defined as those that drip a single drop at intervals no less than one each ten seconds.  A plane with a known leak should be inspected before each flight to ensure that the leak has not grown beyond the allowable limit.  All leaks should be repaired at 12-month inspection.
</p>

<p><b>Leak Repair</b></p>
<p>
    If a leak requiring repair develops in service, remove the inspection plates of the lower side of the wing and with a flashlight and mirror determine which area of the tanks appear to be leaking. This is difficult and sometimes it is necessary to re-seal a large area of the tank to make sure the leak is covered. Remove the fuel line from the tank to be drained and cap it off so that both tanks will not need to be drained. Then drain the fuel into clean containers by removing the drain valve from the tank flange. Then remove the inspection plate on top of the fuel tank nearest the leak area.  There are plate-nuts (NAS680-A4) riveted to the fuel tank top to facilitate plate removal. Sometimes it is necessary to drill out the screws in the plate.
</p>

<p>Inspect inside of the fuel tank with a flashlight and mirror or a drop-light. Observe the warning stated in <xref sectionTarget="2.75.1" prependLabel="Section"></xref> about lights in the tanks. A spark from the switch has caused an explosion and injury in a past instance. Look for a void or air bubble that could have popped, leaving a pin-hole leak. If no suspicious areas are found, prepare to re-seal the general area of the leak. </p>

<p>Clean the areas to be re-sealed with an inhibited alkaline cleaner such as M.E.K. with a clean white rag. A progressive cleaning procedure should be used. Wash one small area at a time, then dry with a clean cloth before solvent evaporates to prevent redeposition of oil or fuel traces. To maintain a clean solvent supply, always pour the solvent on the washing cloth. </p>

<p>The sealer kit consists of the proper proportion of base compound and accelerator. The accelerator contains some volatile materials, which usually come to the surface so it is extremely important to stir the accelerator thoroughly in its container until an even consistency is obtained. Once the accelerator is added to the base material the pot life is limited to two hours at 77°F (25°C), 50% relative humidity for PRC 890B-2 and PR-1422 B2. The pot life for PRC890A-1/2 or PRC-1422 A2 is 30 minutes at the same conditions.  For every 18°F (10°C) rise in temperature, application life is reduced by half, and for every 18°F (10°C) drop it is doubled. High humidity (relative humidity above 80%) at the time of mixing shortens application life. For this reason, it is suggested that only 1/2 of the accelerator is mixed with 1/2 of the base material, so that if the first attempt to seal the tank is unsuccessful, there will be one more mix of sealer left for another attempt before a new can has to be opened. If this approach is taken, be sure the accelerator is sealed in an air-tight container as well as the base material, and that care is taken to assure that exactly 1/2 of each component is mixed together. </p>

<p>Slowly stir the accelerator into the base compound and thoroughly mix approximately 7 to 10 minutes. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the container in order to include the entire compound in the mixture and to assure uniform blending. Scrap mixing paddle periodically to remove unmixed compound. Slow mixing by hand is recommended. </p>

<p>Obtain a small paint brush approximately 1/2" to 3/4" wide and trim the bristles to approximately 1/2" long to increase brush stiffness. Brush the thoroughly mixed sealing compound over the cleaner suspected leak areas in generous amounts but feather out any runs that might occur. Watch for bubbles and re-seal any pin-holes. Inspect your work carefully, as failure means doing the job all over again. Scrape off the old sealer from the fuel tank cover plate and mating surface, being careful not to get any shavings inside the tank. Seal both the cover plate and the mating surface and install cover plate. Where the sealer is squeezed out around the perimeter of the plate, use your finger to make a smooth fillet. </p>

<p>Allow the sealer to dry at least 6 hours (overnight is preferable) before fueling the tank. Check carefully for leaks before connecting the fuel line to the other tank. If the tank still leaks, repeat the entire process until the leak is sealed. </p>
