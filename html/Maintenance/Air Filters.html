<p>The PT6A engine requires a large amount of air at full power settings.  To handle this load while adequately cleaning the air, your Air Tractor is equipped with large, efficient air filters.  The length of service for these filters depends entirely on the operating conditions.  When you replace these filters, use the original equipment filters for replacement.  Cheaper, aftermarket filters are not the same quality, so they neither perform as well nor last as long.  Remember, your engine requires a lot of air to perform properly. Filters should be inspected/cleaned/replaced in accordance with the Inspection Schedule in <xref sectionTarget="3.1" prependLabel="Section"></xref>.  Illumination of the Air Filter CAUTION light indicates that normal air flow through the filter is restricted.  Should the Air Filter CAUTION light illuminate, land as soon as practical and service the air filter system including cleaning or replacing the filter(s) as necessary.  (See instruction below).  <b>Do not rely on this light to determine air filter cleaning/replacement intervals.</b> </p>

<p>For aircraft with the large, cylindrical commercial truck filters (Donaldson p/n P181047 or P510336), removal of these filters is accomplished by removing the airscoop assembly and the aft lower engine cowl.  There is a 3/8" bolt with a check nut on the aft center of each filter, and it is necessary to loosen this bolt before the filters can be removed.  The bolt is to press the filters against the forward wall of the filter box for a tight seal.  With the filters loose, the small support angles are removed and the filters will slide out the bottom opening.  These filters may be cleaned using the instructions in Air Tractor Service Letter 257.  The filters are installed in reverse order of removal. </p>

<p>For aircraft with the p/n 52427-16 Ram Air filter, removal of the filter is accomplished by removing the lower and side cowl skins from the aircraft.  Then completely remove the lower plenum cover to gain access to the filter.  From the right hand side of the airplane, remove the filter retaining band on the aft plenum bulkhead by removing the eight bolts that hold it in place.  The heads of these bolts are on the aft side of the aft plenum bulkhead.  Lastly remove the filter by loosening the four worm drive clamps that hold the filter in place.  This filter may be cleaned using the instructions in Air Tractor Service Letter 257.  The filters are installed in reverse order of removal. </p>

<p>For aircraft with the Brackett BA-413E foam Ram Air filter, removal of the filter element is accomplished by removing the lower and side engine cowls and the lower engine plenum cover.  Remove the center filter support rods by removing the screw on the forward end and sliding them out of their retaining brackets at the aft end.  Remove the old filter element and replace with a new one, ensuring that the filter element completely fills the stainless steel frame, especially in the corners.  Replace the filter support rods, plenum cover, and cowl skins in reverse order of removal.  This filter should not be cleaned, as this may remove the wettant and decrease the filtering ability of the foam.  Any excess dirt or debris that has accumulated on the forward face of the filter may be brushed off with a bristle brush, like a paintbrush, and vacuumed out of the plenum.  The Brackett air filter has a maximum recommended service life of 12 calendar months, regardless of the actual flight time.  The reason is to ensure that acceptable levels of wettant remain in the filter to adequately capture dust and debris. </p>

<p>For aircraft equipped with the 53474-1 XFlow Air filter, see <xref sectionTarget="2.50.50" prependLabel="Section"></xref>.</p>

<p>Operators wishing to retrofit the Donaldson P609713 pleated filter element to an aircraft that is currently equipped with the Brackett BA-413E foam filter element should refer to Service Letter #348 for further instructions.</p>

<p>If desired, operators which currently operate their aircraft with the Donaldson P609713 filter may use the data in Service Letter #289 to modify the air system to allow installation of a Brackett Aircraft BA-413E air filter.</p>

<p>The best way to protect your engine is to avoid contaminated air. This will also improve the life of air filters. To do this, the following steps can be taken:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use ground idle during ground operation to reduce hte amount of dust stirred up by the propeller.</li>
    <li>When loading multiple airplanes, avoid positioning the airplanes in a way such that one airplane will blow contaminants toward the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>If contaminated air is unable to be completely avoided, the following maintenance practices can help to minimize reduced TBOs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Point the airplane into the wind during loading so that contaminates blow away from the engine air inlet.</li>
    <li>Don't wait for the air filter light to perform air filter maintenance.</li>
    <li>Clean filters following the cleaning instructions for your specific filter.</li>
    <li>Replace filters that have reached the end of their life due to hours, age, number of cleanings, or damage.</li>
    <li>Wash the engine per your Pratt and Whitney Maintenance manual. When handling dry fertilizers or corrosive chemicals, an engine wash (compressor and CT) is recommended after the last flight each day.</li>
</ul>


<div class="boxCautionSmall">
    <p class="boxCautionSmallHeader">Note</p>
    <p class="boxCautionSmallText">Frequently inspect the compressor and turbine discs with a borescope to find early erosion or corrosion. This will help minimize TBOs</p>

<p>Turbine powered Air Tractor models are equipped with a Differential Pressure switch (also known as a “Delta-P Switch”) that monitors the pressure drop across the engine air filter. This switch is mounted on the upper aft side of the engine plenum. This pressure switch is made by Dwyer and has a stamped sheet metal cover that is held in place by a single #6 machine screw threaded into the switch housing. There have been instances where this screw became loose because of stripped threads in the switch housing due to over-tightening. </p>

<p>Air Tractor recommends that the switch cover be safety wired with MS20995C25 stainless steel safety wire. as directed in Service Letter #321.</p>
