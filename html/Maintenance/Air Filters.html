<p>The PT6A engine requires a large amount of air at full power settings.  To handle this load while adequately cleaning the air, your Air Tractor is equipped with large, efficient air filters.  The length of service for these filters depends entirely on the operating conditions.  When you replace these filters, use the original equipment filters for replacement.  Cheaper, aftermarket filters are not the same quality, so they neither perform as well nor last as long.  Remember, your engine requires a lot of air to perform properly. Filters should be inspected/cleaned/replaced in accordance with the Inspection Schedule in Section 3.  Illumination of the Air Filter CAUTION light indicates that normal air flow through the filter is restricted.  Should the Air Filter CAUTION light illuminate, land as soon as practical and service the air filter system including cleaning or replacing the filter(s) as necessary.  (See instruction below).  <b>Do not rely on this light to determine air filter cleaning/replacement intervals.</b> </p>

<p>For aircraft with the large, cylindrical commercial truck filters (Donaldson p/n P181047 (alternate is P510336), removal of these filters is accomplished by removing the airscoop assembly and the aft lower engine cowl.  There is a 3/8" bolt with a check nut on the aft center of each filter, and it is necessary to loosen this bolt before the filters can be removed.  The bolt is to press the filters against the forward wall of the filter box for a tight seal.  With the filters loose, the small support angles are removed and the filters will slide out the bottom opening.  These filters may be cleaned using the instructions in Air Tractor Service Letter 257.  The filters are installed in reverse order of removal. </p>

<p>For aircraft with the p/n 52427-16 Ram Air filter, removal of the filter is accomplished by removing the lower and side cowl skins from the aircraft.  Then completely remove the lower plenum cover to gain access to the filter.  From the righthand side of the airplane, remove the filter retaining band on the aft plenum bulkhead by removing the eight bolts that hold it in place.  The heads of these bolts are on the aft side of the aft plenum bulkhead.  Lastly remove the filter by loosening the four worm drive clamps that hold the filter in place.  This filter may be cleaned using the instructions in Air Tractor Service Letter 257.  The filters are installed in reverse order of removal. </p>

<p>For aircraft with the Brackett BA-413E foam Ram Air filter, removal of the filter element is accomplished by removing the lower and side engine cowls and the lower engine plenum cover.  Remove the center filter support rods by removing the screw on the forward end and sliding them out of their retaining brackets at the aft end.  Remove the old filter element and replace with a new one, ensuring that the filter element completely fills the stainless steel frame, especially in the corners.  Replace the filter support rods, plenum cover, and cowl skins in reverse order of removal.  This filter should not be cleaned, as this may remove the wettant and decrease the filtering ability of the foam.  Any excess dirt or debris that has accumulated on the forward face of the filter may be brushed off with a bristle brush, like a paintbrush, and vacuumed out of the plenum.  The Brackett air filter has a maximum recommended service life of 12 calendar months, regardless of the actual flight time.  The reason is to ensure that acceptable levels of wettant remain in the filter to adequately capture dust and debris. </p>
