<p>Details of the stabilizer struts are shown in Figure 66 and Figure 67. 
    The stabilizer struts attach to the fuselage frame with an AN6C13A bolt and to the stabilizer eyebolts with AN6-11A bolts. There are p/n 30256-1 stainless terminals with AN316C8 check nuts at each strut end to allow for adjustment. </p>

    <p>The struts are constructed of 2.36 X 1.00 X .0494130N streamlined tubing and may be repaired if necessary. Check the factory for instructions since an internal tube is installed. They are oiled internally through the threaded fittings on the ends, and should be re-oiled if repaired. They are sand-blasted and given a baked powdered coating for abrasion resistance. At various intervals, the struts should be re-sand-blasted and finished as called out above. Be sure to remove the terminals and plug the open holes before sand-blasting. To further abrasion resistance the leading edge of the strut is covered with 3" wide clear vinyl tape, p/n 8671-3. This tape should be replaced when it becomes loose or tattered. </p>
