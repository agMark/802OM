<p>The compressor is the most expensive component in the air conditioning system loop. The procedure in this section should be used
    to determine if the compressor is functioning correctly. </p>


<ol type="A">
    <li>Compressor Rotation Test
        <p>Most internal compressor failures can be quickly identified by performing a shaft rotation test. Normal
            rotation of
            the compressor shaft should be smooth without catching or binding.</p>
        <p>Compressors which bind or hang during the shaft rotation test have an internal part which is broken or
            contamination
            preventing compressor operation. This compressor should be removed and replaced with a new unit.</p>

    <li>Clutch Inspection
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Voltage Check
                <p>Confirm that the clutch is receiving at a minimum 23 V. If voltage
                    is not being received at the clutch run a diagnostic on the vehicle electrical system. (Note:
                    perform test with
                    power applied to coil to fully load the circuit)</p>
            </li>
            <li>Pulley or Rotor Spin Check
                <p>With clutch disengage the pulley should spin freely with no wobbling or roughness/vibration</p>
            </li>
            <li>Air Gap Check
                <p>Air gaps exceeding 0.051” (1.3 mm) can prevent engagement. This often is noticed after the clutch and
                    compressor
                    temperature is heated through normal use.</p>
                <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
            </li>
            <li>Resistance Check
                <p>Field coils with internal shorts can be tested by measuring resistance across the field coil. Resistance should fall
                    within 14 Ω and 18.2 Ω at room temperature.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Pressure or Pumping Test
        <p>Compressors cause refrigerant to flow through the system by creating a pressure differential, high and low
            pressures. If the compressor can be forced to produce a high pressure in excess of 350 psig it is a good compressor.</p>

            <p class="boxCautionMediumHeader">NOTE</p>
            <p class="boxCautionMediumText">This test must be performed with a full system charge. Confirm the system is charged per

            <p class="boxCautionMediumHeader">CAUTION</p>
            <p class="boxCautionMediumText">This test should only be run for a short time period. Shut the system down immediately

            <li>Disconnect electric cooling fan. The condenser can also be blocked with sheet of card board. The purpose is to
                limit heat removal from the system and build compressor discharge pressure.</li>
            <li>Start engine and engage clutch.</li>
            <li>Compressors operating within specification should be capable of reaching 350 psig.</li>

    <li>Leak Checking
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Visual Inspection
                <p>Although oil seepage does not necessarily indicate leakage of refrigerant, it should be considered a sign that a leak
                    may exist. Look for the following items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oil seepage in shaft seal area (between clutch and compressor) - repairable.</li>
                    <li>Pinching or extrusion of front housing O-ring – non-repairable.</li>
                    <li>Oil around cylinder head (gaskets, service valves, fittings) - repairable.</li>
                    <li>Oil around oil plug - repairable.</li>
                    <li>Stripped threads – non-repairable.</li>
                    <li>Oil around crack in compressor body – non-repairable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Soap Bubble Detection
                <p>Soap bubbles are a means to detect gross leaks. In general one very small bubble released per second is equal to 40
                    oz of refrigerant loss per year. Finding leaks smaller than 40 ounces per year requires an electronic detector.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Shop Type Electronic Detectors
                <p>Ensure that the detector being used is sensitive to R134a refrigerant. Many leak detectors intended for R-12 cannot
                    detect R134a leaks. Use the leak detector in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The leak rate at any
                    portion of the compressor should not exceed 1.0 oz./yr. Make sure that a suspected leak is an actual flow of
                    refrigerant, not a small pocket of refrigerant trapped in a recess. Cleaning the suspect area with soap and water
                    (never a solvent) or blowing off the area with compressed air can help confirm a suspected leak.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Leak Detection Dyes
                <p>Leak detection dyes are to be used in accordance with the manufactures instructions.</p>
                <p>Leak detection dyes work by staining the system oil. So when adding dye to a system which did not initially contain
                    dye the system will need to operate for some time to allow all the oil to become stained and arrive at the leak.</p>

    <li>Noise
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Unusual Noise Not due to Compressor
                <p>Unusual noises may be caused by components other than the compressor</p>
                <p>Compressor Mounting - Check for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loose belt - see belt tension specifications.</li>
                    <li>Broken bracket or compressor mounting ear. Replace broken component.</li>
                    <li>Missing, broken, or loose mounting bolts. Replace, reinstall, or tighten.</li>
                    <li>Drive pad shaft or bearing problem. Inspect drive pad bearing and shaft condition.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Unusual Noises Due to Compressor
                <p>Check for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suction pressure less than about 6 psig can cause unusual noise. Charge refrigerant to proper amount and test by
                        applying heat to evaporator to increase suction pressure.</li>
                    <li>Clutch bearing</li>
                    <li>Oil level--insufficient oil can cause unusual noise.</li>
                    <li>Compressor suction or discharge valve breakage will cause a clacking sound at idle.</li>
                    <li>If head gasket failure occurs, discharge pressure will be low and suction pressure will be high at idle.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
