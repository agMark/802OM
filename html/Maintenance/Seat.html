<p>The seat is attached to the seat rails with two C4-13R-303 Fastpins. Do not raise the seat above factory installed position but a tall person may want to lower the seat some. This is done by removing the fastpin and aligning the holes in the seat attach fitting with one of the other factory pre-drilled holes in the seat rail and installing the fastpins. Make sure the lowered position clears the push-rod from the control stick. </p>

<p>The seat covers wear and need changing from time to time. The back cover is p/n 10541-1 and the bottom cover is p/n 10540-1. If the crotch strap is installed through the bottom seat cover (used with AmSafe Airbag System) use bottom cover p/n 10540-3.  Tools are available from the factory to make seat cover replacement easier. </p>
