<p>Air Tractor installs dry-chemical fire extinguishers in the cockpit. These fire extinguishers are approved for the extinguishing of class A, B, and C fires. For more information on classes of fires, see National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 10. Care must be taken when extinguishing a fire with a dry chemical fire extinguisher. Dry chemical fire extinguishers, when discharged in poorly ventilated areas such as the cockpit, may cause serious impairment to visibility. In addition, they may cause temporary breathing difficulty during and immediately after discharge. For this reason, a dry chemical fire extinguisher must never be used in flight. If there is a fire extinguisher installed in the cockpit, it must be placarded accordingly. If needed, contact an Air Tractor dealer for PIN: 52214-1 placard.</p>

<p>Halon 1301, Halon 1211, or a combination of the two referred to as 1301/1211 has many
advantages. Because it is a gas, it leaves no chemical residue behind to corrode or contaminate aircraft surfaces, parts, or avionics equipment. Other advantages include lower cold shock characteristics on electronic equipment, no degradation of visual acuity, and lower pressures.</p>
