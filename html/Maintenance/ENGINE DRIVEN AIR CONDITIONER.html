<p>All Air Tractor aircraft use a gas-cycle air conditioning system for climate control. The air conditioning system lets the pilot select ram air from outside, re-circulate cockpit air, or a mix of the two. The ram-air control handle location is on the aft-cockpit wall on the RH side of the pilot. </p>

<p>The 53126-X compressor has five reciprocating pistons driven by a rotating wobble-plate. It uses reed-type valves to control flow at the suction and pressure ports. Mechanical power to drive the compressor comes from an engine accessory drive pad. Gears in the engine drive are a splined-quill shaft that turns a small poly “V” groove pulley that drives the flywheel pulley with a serpentine belt. The flywheel pulley is connected to the compressor shaft by an electromagnetic clutch. </p>

<p>The 53126-X compressor is factory-charged to the correct level with Sanden SP-15 oil. The initial oil charge is 210 cc. It is not necessary to check the compressor’s oil level as routine maintenance. The oil level must be checked when a system component has been replaced or if you think there is an oil leak. All refrigerant must be removed from the system (depressurized) before the oil is checked. </p>

<p>The air conditioner fans, blowers, and compressor clutch are powered by the aircraft bus. All control switches for the air conditioning system are located on the Instrument Panel. The pilot can use the switches to turn the system on or off and to control the cockpit-blower speed as HIGH, MED, or LOW. </p>

<p>A Freon Recycling Unit (FRU) that reclaims the R-134a refrigerant is recommended when refrigerant is added or removed. </p>

<p>Servicing procedures for the air conditioner are generally the same as those for comparable automotive units. Most servicing is accomplished by adding or removing Refrigerant R-134a at the servicing ports. These ports are located beneath the upper right-hand side skin immediately aft of the cockpit. </p>



    

    <p><li><b>Application Specifications</b></li></p>
    <p><b>A. Oil Flow Theory</b></p>
    <p>-Compressor lubrication occurs as the oil which circulates with the refrigerant passes through the compressor crankcase during operation. The Sanden SD series compressor achieves optimal durability and cooling performance when oil circulates through the system at a ratio of 3.3% to 8% oil to refrigerant. Excess oil can act as an insulator limiting heat transfer in the evaporator and condenser, while too little oil can negatively affect durability. </p>
    <p>-Oil will collect in low pressure cool components (evaporator, accumulator and suction hose) of the refrigerant loop. For example a long suction hose which sags can collect several ounces thus reducing overall oil circulation ratio. </p>
    <b><p>B. Oil Changing</p></b>
    <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
    <p>a) For a new compressor to be used in this type of system, subtract the delivered oil amount from the desired total oil charge to determine how much oil should be added to the compressor and system.  (For total system required oil amount, see Section 2C System Requirements). </p>
    <p>b)Remove the oil filler plug and charge the compressor with the amount of additional oil determined in step a).  Use only new oil of the correct type as shown on the compressor label. If calculated amount is greater than 300cc (10oz) oil can be added to other system components.  </p>
    <p>c) Re-install oil plug. Seat and O-ring must be clean and not damaged. Torque to 11-18 ft•lb (15-25 N•m, 150-200 kgf•cm). </p>

    <li><b>Diagnosis Confirmation of Compressor Failure</b></li>
        <p>The compressor is the most expensive component in the air conditioning system loop. Steps A through D should be used to determine if the compressor is functioning correctly or not and prevent removal of a good compressor. </p>

       <p><b>A. Compressor Rotation Test</b></p> 

       <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">

       <p>-Most internal compressor failures can be quickly identified by performing a shaft rotation test. Normal rotation of the compressor shaft should be smooth without catching or binding.</p>
       <p>-Compressors which bind or hang during the shaft rotation test have an internal part which is broken or contamination preventing compressor operation. This compressor should be removed and replaced with a new unit.  </p>

       <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
       <p>a) Voltage Check</p>
       <p><b>12 Volts</b></p>
       <p>-Confirm that the clutch is receiving at a minimum11.5 V or 23 V for 12 V and 24 V systems respectively. If voltage is not being received at the clutch run a diagnostic on the vehicle electrical system. (Note: perform test with power applied to  coil to fully load the circuit) </p>
       <p>-Pulley or Rotor Spin Check</p>
       <p>-With clutch disengage the pulley should spin freely  with no wobbling or roughness/vibration </p>

       <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
       <p>b) Air Gap Check</p>
       <p>-Air gaps exceeding 0.051” (1.3 mm) can prevent engagement. This often is noticed after the clutch and compressor temperature is heated through normal use.</p>
       
       <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
       <p><b>3.2 Ohms</b></p>

       <p>c) Resistance Check</p>
       <p>-Field coils with internal shorts can be tested by measuring resistance across the field coil.  Resistance should fall within these values. </p>
       <p>--12 Volt coil resistance should measure between2.8 Ω and 4.4 Ω @ room temperature </p>
       <p>--24 Volt coil resistance should measure between  14 Ω and 18.2 Ω @ room temperature </p>

<b><p>C. Pressure or Pumping Test</p></b>
    <p>-Compressors cause refrigerant to flow through the system by creating a pressure differential, high and low pressures. If the compressor can be forced to produce a high pressure in excess of 350 psig it is a good compressor. </p>

    <p><b><u>Important:</u></b><b>This test must be performed with a full system charge! Confirm the system is charged per Air Tractor requirements in this section before proceeding.</b></p>
    <p>a) Disconnect electric cooling fan.  The condenser can also be blocked with sheet of card board. The purpose is to limit heat removal from the system and build compressor discharge pressure. </p>
    <p>b) Start engine and engage clutch. </p>
    <p>c) Compressors operating within specification should be capable of reaching 350 psig. </p>
    <p><b><u>Important:</u></b><b>This test should only be run for a short time period. Shut the system down immediately once 350 psig is achieved.</b>

 <b><p>D. Leak Checking</p></b>
    <p>a) Visual Inspection</p>
        <p>Although oil seepage does not necessarily indicate leakage of refrigerant, it should be considered a sign that a leak may exist. Look for the following items: </p>
        <p>-Oil seepage in shaft seal area (between clutch and compressor) - repairable. </p>
        <p>-Pinching or extrusion of front housing O-ring – non-repairable. </p>
        <p>-Oil around cylinder head (gaskets, service valves, fittings) - repairable. </p>
        <p>-Oil around oil plug - repairable. </p>
        <p>-Stripped threads – non-repairable. </p>
        <p>-Oil around crack in compressor body – non-repairable. </p>
    <p>b) Soap Bubble Detetcion</p>
        <p>-Soap bubbles are a means to detect gross leaks. In general one very small bubble released per second is equal to 40 oz of refrigerant loss per year. Finding leaks smaller than 40 ounces per year requires an electronic detector. </p>
    <p>c) Shop Type Electronic Detectors</p>
        <p>-Ensure that the detector being used is sensitive to R134a refrigerant. Many leak detectors intended for R-12 cannot detect R134a leaks. Use the leak detector in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The leak rate at any portion of the compressor should not exceed 1.0 oz./yr. Make sure that a suspected leak is an actual flow of refrigerant, not a  small pocket of refrigerant trapped in a recess. Cleaning the suspect area with soap and water (never a solvent) or blowing off the area with compressed air can help confirm a suspected leak. </p>
    <p>d) Leak Detection Dyes</p>
        <p>-Leak detection dyes are to be used in accordance with the manufactures instructions.</p>
        <p>-Leak detection dyes work by staining the system oil. So when adding dye to a system which  did not initially contain dye the system will need to operate for some time to allow all the oil to  become stained and arrive at the leak. </p>

<p><b>E. Noise</b></p>
        <p>a) Unusual Noise Not due to Compressor</p>
<p>Unusual noises may be caused by components other than the compressor</p> 
<p>Compressor Mounting - Check for: </p>
        <p>-Loose belt - see belt tension specifications. </p>
        <p>-Broken bracket or compressor mounting ear. Replace broken component. </p>
        <p>-Missing, broken, or loose mounting bolts. Replace, reinstall, or tighten. </p>
        <p>-Drive pad shaft or bearing problem. Inspect drive pad bearing and shaft condition. </p>

        <p>b) Unusual Noises Due to Compressor</p>
        <p>-Suction pressure less than about 6 psig can cause unusual noise. Charge refrigerant to proper amount and test by applying heat to evaporator to increase suction pressure. </p>
        <p>-Clutch bearing </p>
        <p>-Oil level--insufficient oil can cause unusual noise.  </p>
        <p>-Compressor suction or discharge valve breakage will cause a clacking sound at idle. </p>
        <p>-If head gasket failure occurs, discharge pressure will be low and suction pressure will be high at idle. </p>

<b><p>*Note: Over torque of SD508/SH14 dust cover bolts will cause air gap to become out of spec.  </p></b>
        <p><b>C. Removing and Replacing the Compressor  </b></p>
    
        <p>To remove the compressor, these steps should be followed:  </p>
                <p>-Remove all refrigerant from the system using a Freon Recovery Unit (FRU).  </p>
                <p>-Remove the hose fittings at the rear of the compressor by first removing the bolt and strap that hold the T-head clamp in place. The hose fittings can now be removed from the compressor’s head without tools.</p>
                <p>-Separate the wrist-lock connector in the wire that powers the clutch.  </p>
                <p>-Loosen the nuts on the two AN5 pivot bolts that secure the compressor to the drive-shaft housing.  </p>
                <p>-Remove safety wire and loosen the belt-tension turnbuckle and remove belts.  </p>
                <p>-Remove the bolt that connects the belt-adjustment turnbuckle to the compressor case.  </p>
                  <p>-Support the compressor and remove the AN5 bolts and nuts that secure the compressor to the drive-shaft housing. This also releases the turnbuckle that serves as a side brace.  </p>
                   <p>-Gently lift the compressor from the engine compartment.  </p>

    <p>To replace the compressor, the previous steps should be followed in the reverse order. The belts for the R12 system should be tensioned to 10 lbs using a Deco densitometer or equivalent. Tension the flat serpentine belt of the R134a system as described in Service Letter #159. </p>
    <p>Use compatible refrigeration oil on the O-rings at the compressor-hose fitting before reconnecting to compressor. Follow evacuation and refrigerant charging instructions spelled out in this section of this manual. </p>

    <li><b><p>Compressor Replacement</p></b></li>

            <p>-It’s critical for successful compressor replacement that the new compressor is installed in a clean system with a correct oil charge. Contamination remaining in the system will be pulled into the new compressor and lodge under the valves and in bearings causing quick failure of the new compressor. Also it’s important to maintain the original oil charge amount when replacing the compressor. </p>

        <p><b>A. Contamination Inspection</b></p>
            <p>-Contamination from foreign material can be found by looking at the oil drained from either the compressor or the suction and discharge lines. Contamination can also be seen collecting in the orifice tube or expansion valve.</p>
        <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
        <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
            <p>-To illustrate how contamination will quickly wreck a good compressor, the photo to the right shows a small metal shaving lodged under the discharge valve. The valve will open and close against the metal shaving resulting in a fatigue break of the valve. The broken valve is now free to travel inside the compressor causing additional internal failures. Eventually the compressor will stop pumping and over heat. </p>

         <p><b>B. Oil Amount (Flushed System or New Systems)</b></p>   
            <p>-Systems which have no oil in them due to flushing or the system is being built from new components will require oil amounts in accordance with the oil charging section requirements in this manual. </p>
    <p><b>Note:</b></p> <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
            <p>-The factory oil charge for the compressor can be found on the compressor label.  For total system required oil amount, see Section 2C, System Requirements.  Also see oil charging section of this manual for additional information. </p>
            <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png"><p><b>Oil Amount (Compressor swap, no flushing)</p></b>
                <p>-The goal of this procedure is to measure the oil  amount in the failed compressor and adjust the  amount in the new compressor to equal that of  the failed.  </p>
            <p>a) Remove the oil plug from the failed compressor and drain as much oil as possible into a suitable container. </p>
            <p>b) Drain oil from the suction and discharge ports into a suitable container while turning the shaft clockwise only with a socket wrench on the armature retaining nut. </p>
            <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
            <p>c) Measure and record the amount of oil drained from the compressor. </p>
            <p>d) Drain oil from the new compressor following steps a) and b). </p>
            <p>e) Add oil back into the new compressor in an amount equal measurement taken in step c). </p>
            <p>f) Re-install oil plug. Seal and O-ring must be clean and not damaged. Torque to 11-15 ft•lb (15-20 N•m, 150-200 kgf•cm). Be careful not to cross thread the oil plug</p>

<li><b><p>Service Procedures</p></b></li>

                <b><p>A. Flushing</p></b>
                    <p>a) Equipment Types</p>
                        <p>-Refrigerant recovery recycle machines which contain a flushing circulating pump to solvent- clean using R134a. </p>
                        <p>-A closed loop flushing machine in which the circulated flushing fluid is returned to a reservoir for filtering and continued circulation. Most of these machines provide a pulsing action to dislodge particles that are stuck in small passageways. </p>
                        <p>-A pressurized flush gun with a pulsating spray can also be used. To use this technique, block one end of a air conditioning system component being flushed in order to build pressure inside the component, and then quickly release the blockage to pulse the flushing solvent out. </p>

                    <p>b) Safety</p>
                        <p>-Do not use flammable fluids. </p>
                        <p>-Protect eyes with safety goggles. </p>
                        <p>-Wear chemical resistant gloves. </p>
                        <p>-Use approved fluids. CFCs R-11,113 or 115 and Methyl Chloroform also known as 1,1,1, Trichloroethane are not acceptable per the Clean Air Act. </p>
                    
                    <p>c) Acceptable Flushing Fluids </p>
                        <p>-Fluids designated for air conditioning flushing should be used and may be either solvent or lubricant based. Fluids used to flush the system should meet SAE specification J2670 to insure compatibility with refriger ant, oil and any materials used in the air conditioning system. </p>

                    <p>d) Components to Flush </p>
                        <p>-Flush hoses, hard lines and heat exchangers. DO NOT flush the compressor, accumulator or receiver drier, refrigerant lines with mufflers, thermal expansion valve or orifice tube because residual flushing fluid cannot be removed from these components and they restrict the flow of flushing agent through other components. </p>

                    <p>e) Why Suction Side Flushing Is Important </p>
                        <p>-When the off-cycle pressure equalizes in the backwards direction through damaged compressor valves, debris may be forced back up the suction hose. If it is not removed, this debris will travel into the replacement compressor and be circulated throughout the air conditioning system, causing subsequent failures. </p>

                    <p>f) Flushing Rear Evaporator Lines </p>
                        <p>-Debris is distributed throughout the entire air conditioning system so it is important to flush the rear lines.  The rear expansion valve can be gutted or drilled out and remounted so that the rear evaporator and hoses can be back flushed as an assembly. After blowing out the flushing fluid and fumes a new thermal expansion valve should be mounted. </p>

                    <p>g) Importance Of Flushing Direction </p>
                        <p>-“Back flush”, or flushing in the reverse direction to normal flow, is the most effective. The plate fin evaporators used on many front and rear evaporators have many small passages which are difficult to clean without a strong pulsating reverse flow. </p>

                    <p>h) How long do I flush? </p>
                        <p>-Closed loop procedure, flush until the flushing fluid leaving the air conditioning components are clean.  Manual pressurized gun method requires a minimum of three times, but more if exiting fluid is not clean. </p>

                    <p>i) Removal of Residual Flushing Fluid before Evacuation and Charge </p>
                        <p>-The primary vacuum pump should be protected from flushing fluid and fumes. Purging of flushing solvent is necessary before connecting the recovery recycle machine to evacuate and charge the air conditioning system. The best method is to allow Nitrogen to flow through the components. If Nitrogen is not available, clean and dried compressed air can be blown through the flushed components until the flush liquid is evaporated. </p>

                <p><b>B. Evacuation</b></p>
                        <p>-Evacuation is the process of removing air and moisture from the refrigeration system before charging the system with refrigerant. Air or moisture remaining in the system before and during the refrigerant charge process will cause increased pressures during operation resulting in reduced or poor cooling and greatly reduce the compressor life. </p>

                    <p></p> a) Explanation of Evacuation</p>
                        <p></b>-As vacuum is increased the temperature at which water boils drops. As the water/moisture boils its vapor can be drawn out of the system by the vacuum pump. It is recommended to perform the evacuation process in a warm area. The vehicle engine can also be run in order to warm up the components of the air conditioning system to enhance the evacuation process. </p>
                        <p>-Allow the vacuum pump to run for 30 minutes drawing down near to 30” Hg. After 30 minutes of evacuation close the service valves and turn off the pump. Let the system sit for 10 minutes, if vacuum loss of 2” or greater occurs there is probably a leak. </p>
                            <p>--Other reasons a vacuum cannot be held for 10 minutes after shut off. </p>
                            <p>---Flush was not completely removed from system before evacuation started. </p>
                            <p>---Refrigerant is trapped in refrigerant oil from previous charge. </p>
                    <p >b) Vacuum Pump Service </p>
                        <p>Vacuum pumps not receiving regular service will be unable to draw an adequate vacuum. In most cases simple changing the pumps oil will correct the problem. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for any maintenance on your evacuation pump. Change the oil after use while the oil is still hot, because contaminants are still in suspension and will be removed with the oil. If contaminants cool, solidify and stay in the pump, they lower vacuum efficiency. In extreme cases, the oil stops lubricating and the pump seizes. The only way to determine oil condition is to test vacuum pulled with an electronic vacuum gauge.  Contamination cannot be determined by oil color. </p>

                        <p>-Electronic weight scale</p>
                        <p>-Charging stations</p>

        <b><p>Safety Note</p></b>
                    <p><b>Never open the high side service valve with the system running! This can damage equipment and cause bodily injury. </b></p>

                    <p> b) Two ways to charge the system </p>
                        <p>1. Through the high side with air conditioning system off. </p>
                        <p>-Charge systems that heat the refrigerant will force the correct charge amount into the system. Once the full charge has been dispensed the service valve must be closed and the air conditioning system can be started. </p>

                        <p>2. Through the low side with the system running. </p>
                        <p>-With the engine running at flight-idle speed (approximately 75 percent Ng) with the propeller in the feathered position. The air conditioner master switch is turned ON. The blower switch is turned ON HIGH, and the service gauges are monitored to see that the reading on the high-pressure gauge is increasing while the reading on the low-pressure gauge is decreasing. If the gauges fail to behave as specified, turn the air conditioner master switch OFF, stop the engine, and investigate the cause of the compressor’s failure to engage. If the gauges behave properly, then charging can continue. </p>

                        <p>-Refrigerant is introduced into the low-pressure service valve while the compressor is operating. The low pressure manifold valve should be opened to allow slow increases in pressure in both the high- and -low pressure sides of the system. This filling should continue until the low-pressure side of the system stabilizes at 28 to 32 psi and the high pressure side is between 200 and 250 psi. The sight-glass on top of the receiver/dryer should show clear liquid flow without bubbles.  </p>

                <p><b>D. System Oil Balance</b></p>

                    <p>a) Oil Flow</p>
                        <p>-Compressor lubrication occurs as the oil which circulates with the refrigerant passes through the compressor crankcase during operation. The Sanden SD series compressor achieves optimal durability and cooling performance when oil circulates through the system at a ratio of 3.3% to 8% oil to refrigerant. Excess oil can act as an insulator limiting heat transfer in the evaporator and condenser, while too little oil can negatively affect durability. </p>

                    <p>b) Oil Checking Is Not Required Under Normal Conditions </p>
                        <p>-The mobile refrigeration system is a closed loop system, hence it is not necessary to check or change oil in systems functioning normally and not in need of repair. The system isolates the oil and refrigerant from moisture and contaminants, while normal operating temperatures will be well below a point that will cause oil degradation. </p>
                    
                        <p>c) When Oil Addition or Balancing is required </p>
                            <p>-Compressor or component replacement </p>
                            <p>-Loss of refrigerant and oil mixture </p>
                            <p>-Adding oil to the system is required when refrigerant loss occurs due to leakage at any system component. Since oil is held in suspension with the refrigerant, oil will be lost with the escaping refrigerant gas. Oil will need to be inspected for contamination  during repairs to determine if flushing is required.</p>
                        
                        <p>e) System Oil Amount</p>
                            <p>-Oil circulates with the refrigerant during operation. During off periods oil will settle in all system components with more collecting in cool components like evaporators, accumulator and suction lines. </p>

                        <p>f) Oil Replacement Amount During Service </p>
                            <p>-When replacing a system component the goal is to restore to the original factory oil amount. Use the chart below as a guide for restoring oil quantities when replacing system components. </p>

<p><b>8. Common Causes of Compressor Failure</b></p>
    <p><b>A. Compressor Overheated</b></p>
        <p>-Overheating is most often caused by loss of refrigerant charge. Cool suction side refrigerant returning from the evaporator provides cooling for the compressor. Once the refrigerant charge is lost there is no refrigerant entering the compressor, hence no compressor cooling.  Blockages in the system will also prevent cool refrigerant flow to the compressor. </p>

    <p><b>B. Compressor Contaminated</b></p>
     <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png"> 
         <p>There are several types of contamination.  The most common types are: </p>
            <p>-Foreign material like metal chips, dirt and desiccant. Resulting in broken internal  compressor components eventually locking up  the compressor </p>
            <p>-Moisture from improper evacuation or hose permeation. Moisture will corrode internal parts resulting in failure. Moisture will create higher system pressures or freeze in the expansion device and blocking refrigerant flow. </p>
            <p>-Air Conditioning system flush </p>
            <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png"> 
    <p><b>C. Clutch Slippage</b></p>
         <p>->The compressor clutch is simply two friction surfaces forced together, like a set of brakes.  Each time the clutch is engaged some amount heat is generated. If the engagements occur rapidly or the system voltage is to low, excessive heat created will cause failure of bearing seals and or melting of the field coil epoxy. </p>
    <p><b>D. Handling or Impact Damage </b></p>
         <p>-Striking, dropping or over torque will result in these types of damage: </p>
