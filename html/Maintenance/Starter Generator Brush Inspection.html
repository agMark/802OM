<p>This section provides instructions for cleaning the starter generator and inspecting the brushes.  These instructions have been historically published in Service Letter 212 and are now provided in this section for convenience.</p>

<p>Skurka Aerospace also publishes several documents on this topic to assist with the maintenance of their starter generators.  In particular, one should reference:</p>

<p>
Brush and commutator wear is a function of electrical load, 
environmental conditions, and brush grade. Brush performance is 
subject to aircraft operation methods (i.e. short flights vs. long 
flights). Short flights, with a high number of starts, degrade 
brushes quickly and reduces brush life. During operations, 
individual brush wear rates may vary significantly dependent upon 
selectivity (the tendency for a higher percentage of total current 
flow to travel through one brush), heavy electrical loads, brush 
type, and variations in brush block spring tension.

    For these reasons, Air Tractor recommends periodic brush checks 
    <xref sectionTarget="3.1.12" prependLabel="Section"></xref>. Along with the brush check, a 
    thorough inspection and cleaning of the starter generator should 
    be accomplished. The following is provided as a general guide to 
    perform the inspection.
</p>

<p><b>Procedure</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Remove starter generator.</li>
    <li>
        Inspect for overall condition and signs of overheating.  Visually inspect for damage to components such as fan, shroud, shaft, and main terminals.</li>
    <li>
        Stand unit vertically and remove brush cover. Mark brushes and 
        holders to ensure brushes can be returned to the original holder, 
        or remove brushes one at a time to inspect for wear and service 
        life remaining. A properly seated brush will have uniform wear and 
        display a smooth / semi-gloss surface. A minimum of 75% in the 
        axial direction and 100% in the rotational direction is 
        recommended.        
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove carbon dust using compressed air. Starting at the shaft 
        (drive) end, working your way toward the fan (anti-drive) end. 
    </li>
    <li>
        With brushes removed, inspect commutator appearance. If commutator 
        is grooved, it is recommended that the commutator be resurfaced by 
        a qualified repair station prior to a brush change. If commutator 
        is damaged, it is recommended that the unit be returned to a 
        qualified repair station for service.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rotate the unit slowly in the direction of normal rotation. Normal 
        rotation can be found on the I.D. plate and is interpreted with 
        the splined shaft facing you. The bearings should rotate 
        relatively smooth with no evident binding. If damage is suspected, 
        it is recommended that the unit be returned to a qualified repair 
        station for service.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using an Ohmmeter, check the insulation resistance between 
        Positive terminal B(+) and the housing. Resistance measurement 
        should be 10K Ohms or greater. If resistance measurement is less 
        than 10K Ohms, clean the generator with compressed air again and 
        retest. If the generator does not pass the electrical resistance 
        check, it is recommended that the unit be returned to a qualified 
        repair station for service. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect brush lead formation to ensure that the brushes can travel 
        freely through the holder with brush wear. If a brush “hangs up” 
        in the holder, it may lose contact with the commutator causing the 
        generator to fail. 
    </li>
    <li>
        If a brush change is required, consult the appropriate starter 
        generator manufacturer instructions for brush installation, 
        seating, lead formation, and run-in. 
    </li>
</ol>
