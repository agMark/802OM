            <li>Equipment Types
                <p>Refrigerant recovery recycle machines which contain a flushing circulating pump to solvent- clean
                    using
                    R134a.</p>
                <p>A closed loop flushing machine in which the circulated flushing fluid is returned to a reservoir for
                    filtering and
                    continued circulation. Most of these machines provide a pulsing action to dislodge particles that
                    are
                    stuck
                    in small
                    passageways.</p>
                <p>A pressurized flush gun with a pulsating spray can also be used. To use this technique, block one end
                    of
                    a
                    air
                    conditioning system component being flushed in order to build pressure inside the component, and
                    then
                    quickly
                    release the blockage to pulse the flushing solvent out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Safety
                <p>Do not use flammable fluids.</p>
                <p>Protect eyes with safety goggles.</p>
                <p>Wear chemical resistant gloves.</p>
                <p>Use approved fluids. CFCs R-11,113 or 115 and Methyl Chloroform also known as 1,1,1, Trichloroethane
                    are
                    not
                    acceptable per the Clean Air Act.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Acceptable Flushing Fluids
                <p>Fluids designated for air conditioning flushing should be used and may be either solvent or lubricant
                    based. Fluids
                    used to flush the system should meet SAE specification J2670 to insure compatibility with refriger
                    ant,
                    oil and any
                    materials used in the air conditioning system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Components to Flush
                <p>Flush hoses, hard lines and heat exchangers. DO NOT flush the compressor, accumulator or receiver
                    drier,
                    refrigerant
                    lines with mufflers, thermal expansion valve or orifice tube because residual flushing fluid cannot
                    be
                    removed from
                    these components and they restrict the flow of flushing agent through other components.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Why Suction Side Flushing Is Important
                <p>When the off-cycle pressure equalizes in the backwards direction through damaged compressor valves,
                    debris may be
                    forced back up the suction hose. If it is not removed, this debris will travel into the replacement
                    compressor and
                    be circulated throughout the air conditioning system, causing subsequent failures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Flushing Rear Evaporator Lines
                <p>Debris is distributed throughout the entire air conditioning system so it is important to flush the
                    rear
                    lines. The
                    rear expansion valve can be gutted or drilled out and remounted so that the rear evaporator and
                    hoses
                    can be back
                    flushed as an assembly. After blowing out the flushing fluid and fumes a new thermal expansion valve
                    should be
                    mounted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Importance Of Flushing Direction
                <p>“Back flush”, or flushing in the reverse direction to normal flow, is the most effective. The plate
                    fin
                    evaporators
                    used on many front and rear evaporators have many small passages which are difficult to clean
                    without a
                    strong
                    pulsating reverse flow.</p>
            </li>
            <li>How long do I flush?
                <p>Closed loop procedure, flush until the flushing fluid leaving the air conditioning components are
                    clean.
                    Manual
                    pressurized gun method requires a minimum of three times, but more if exiting fluid is not clean.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Removal of Residual Flushing Fluid before Evacuation and Charge
                <p>The primary vacuum pump should be protected from flushing fluid and fumes. Purging of flushing
                    solvent is
                    necessary
                    before connecting the recovery recycle machine to evacuate and charge the air conditioning system.
                    The
                    best method
                    is to allow Nitrogen to flow through the components. If Nitrogen is not available, clean and dried
                    compressed air
                    can be blown through the flushed components until the flush liquid is evaporated.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Evacuation
        <p>Evacuation is the process of removing air and moisture from the refrigeration system before charging the
            system with
            refrigerant. Air or moisture remaining in the system before and during the refrigerant charge process will
            cause
            increased pressures during operation resulting in reduced or poor cooling and greatly reduce the compressor
            life.</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Explanation of Evacuation</li>
            <p>As vacuum is increased the temperature at which water boils drops. As the water/moisture boils its vapor
                can be
                drawn out of the system by the vacuum pump. It is recommended to perform the evacuation process in a
                warm area. The
                vehicle engine can also be run in order to warm up the components of the air conditioning system to
                enhance the
                evacuation process.</p>

            <p>Allow the vacuum pump to run for 30 minutes drawing down near to 30” Hg. After 30 minutes of evacuation
                close the
                service valves and turn off the pump. Let the system sit for 10 minutes, if vacuum loss of 2” or greater
                occurs
                there is probably a leak.</p>
            <p>Other reasons a vacuum cannot be held for 10 minutes after shut off:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flush was not completely removed from system before evacuation started.</li>
                <li>Refrigerant is trapped in refrigerant oil from previous charge.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Vacuum Pump Service</li>
            <p>Vacuum pumps not receiving regular service will be unable to draw an adequate vacuum. In most cases
                simple changing
                the pumps oil will correct the problem. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for any
                maintenance on
                your evacuation pump. Change the oil after use while the oil is still hot, because contaminants are
                still in
                suspension and will be removed with the oil. If contaminants cool, solidify and stay in the pump, they
                lower vacuum
                efficiency. In extreme cases, the oil stops lubricating and the pump seizes. The only way to determine
                oil condition
                is to test vacuum pulled with an electronic vacuum gauge. Contamination cannot be determined by oil
                color.</p>

                    feathered
                    position. The air conditioner master switch is turned ON. The blower switch is turned ON HIGH, and
                    the service
                    gauges are monitored to see that the reading on the high-pressure gauge is increasing while the
                    reading on the
                    low-pressure gauge is decreasing. If the gauges fail to behave as specified, turn the air
                    conditioner master switch
                    OFF, stop the engine, and investigate the cause of the compressor’s failure to engage. If the gauges
                    behave
                    properly, then charging can continue.</p>
                <p>Refrigerant is introduced into the low-pressure service valve while the compressor is operating. The
                    low pressure
                    manifold valve should be opened to allow slow increases in pressure in both the high- and -low
                    pressure sides of the
                    system. This filling should continue until the low-pressure side of the system stabilizes at 28 to
                    32 psi and the
                    high pressure side is between 200 and 250 psi. The sight-glass on top of the receiver/dryer should

    <li>System Oil Balance
        <ul type="a">
            <li>Oil Flow
                <p>Compressor lubrication occurs as the oil which circulates with the refrigerant passes through the
                    compressor
                    crankcase during operation. The Sanden SD series compressor achieves optimal durability and cooling
                    performance when
                    oil circulates through the system at a ratio of 3.3% to 8% oil to refrigerant. Excess oil can act as
                    an insulator
                    limiting heat transfer in the evaporator and condenser, while too little oil can negatively affect
                    durability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Oil Checking Is Not Required Under Normal Conditions
                <p>The mobile refrigeration system is a closed loop system, hence it is not necessary to check or change
                    oil in systems
                    functioning normally and not in need of repair. The system isolates the oil and refrigerant from
                    moisture and
                    contaminants, while normal operating temperatures will be well below a point that will cause oil
                    degradation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>When Oil Addition or Balancing is required:
                <ul>
                    <li>Compressor or component replacement</li>
                    <li>Loss of refrigerant and oil mixture</li>
                    <li>Adding oil to the system is required when refrigerant loss occurs due to leakage at any system
                        component. Since oil
                        is held in suspension with the refrigerant, oil will be lost with the escaping refrigerant gas.
                        Oil will need to be
                        inspected for contamination during repairs to determine if flushing is required.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>System Oil Amount
                <p>Oil circulates with the refrigerant during operation. During off periods oil will settle in all
                    system components
                    with more collecting in cool components like evaporators, accumulator and suction lines.</p>

            <li>Oil Replacement Amount During Service
                <p>When replacing a system component the goal is to restore to the original factory oil amount. Use the chart below as
