<p>The parking brake valve sued on later Air Tractor's is a Scott p/n 4500A-2.  Two of these valves are mounted together with a common lever to pull the valve to the ON position.  O-Rings within the valves may be replaced when needed.  An exploded view of the parking-brake valve is shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_35.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. </p>

<p>The proper operation of the parking valve is as follows:</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>To set the parking brakes:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply brakes.</li>
        <li>Pull on the parking brake handle.</li>
        <li>Release the brake pedal pressure.</li>
</ul>

    <li>To release the parking brakes:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Depress brake pedal.</li>
        <li>The parking brake valve should release when enough brake pedal pressure is applied.</li>
        <li>If not the valve can be gently pushed in to release the parking brakes.</li>
        <li>Release brake pedal pressure.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<div class="boxCautionLarge">
    <p class="boxCautionLargeHeader">CAUTION</p>
    <p class="boxCautionLargeText">Applying brake pressure, before pushing the parking brake handle in, relieves the force required to unlock the parking valve. Forcing the parking brake valve in will damage the internal parts of the valve and cause the valve to malfunction.</p>
</div>


<p>Leaking of brake fluid from the top of the valve body indicates failure to the O-rings that seals the valve stem.  O-ring replacement may be performed by removing the defective valve body only.  O-ring replacement may be done using the following steps: </p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Clamp the fluid-supply line for the brake reservoir to the master cylinder. </li>

    <li>Remove the long AN3 bolts and nuts that clamp the valve bodies together. </li>

    <li>Pull both valve bodies free of their support bracket. </li>

    <li>Remove the AN3 bolt and spacers from the actuating levers. The bolt is threaded into the red knob.</li>

    <li>Separate the valve bodies.</li>

    <li>Remove the brake lines from the ports in the near side and lower the end of the valve body.</li>

    <li>Clip the end of the 3/32-inch-Dia. x 5/8-inch-long steel rivet that secures the actuating arm to the valve stem.</li>

    <li>Remove the rivets and washers, freeing the arm from the valve stem.</li>

    <li>While holding the valve body gently in a smooth-jaw vise, remove the elbow-fitting and large fitting (valve seat) at the lower end of the valve body. </li>

    <li>Remove the 3/4-inch-OD x 9/16-inch-ID O-ring from the valve seat. </li>

    <li>Remove the spacer from the top of the valve stem and push the valve stem out of the valve body through the hole normally filled by the valve seat. </li>

    <li>Using an O-ring pick, remove the 3/8-inch-OD x 1/4-inch-ID O-ring from the lower end of the bore that guides the valve stem. </li>
</ol>

<p>Blow the bore clean with compressed air, then coat the bore with MIL-H-5606 brake fluid. Do not use any other solvents to clean the bore. </p>

<p>Coat the replacement O-ring with MIL-H-5606 brake fluid and slide into position in the annular groove in the valve-stem housing. All parts to be reassembled should be coated with fluid before assembly. The remainder of the replacement can be done by working backwards from Step 11 of the removal procedure. The rivet that was destroyed in Step 7 above can be replaced with Scott part number 18286 or other suitable 3/32" x 5/8" R.H. steel rivet. </p>

<p>After the parking-brake valve is returned to the airplane and hoses are reconnected, the brakes must be bled as described in <xref sectionTarget="2.90.13" prependLabel="Section"></xref> of this manual. </p>
