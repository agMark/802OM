<p>Details for the main-gear attachment bolts are shown in Figure 72. Details for the tail-gear attachment bolts are shown in Figure 73.  The bolts attaching the main and tail gear springs to the fuselage structure are among the most important structural components of the aircraft. Being structural components under constant stress, these bolts have definite fatigue lives. The predictability of the fatigue life of each bolt is impossible due to the wide variety of operating conditions that include smoothness of landing strips, number of landings per hour, pilot landing technique, load carried, the way the turns on the ground are made, the way the brakes are used, and many other small but significant factors. Dropping in over the trees and hitting the ground during a spray run may not cause a gear bolt failure, but the effect on the fatigue life of the bolt could be the same as several thousand landings on a rough strip. A bolt that is not tightened to the proper torque, especially when there is visible clearance between the gear spring and the fuselage, will last only a fraction of the time normally expected. </p>

<p>We have established what we feel is a conservative, yet realistic time period for gear bolt changes, based on field experience at this time. The bolt life shown is based on normal operations. If you discover slack in the large 1 1/8" bolt attaching the main gear leg, change it immediately. </p>

<p>Main and tail gear attachment bolt fatigue lives are listed in Section 3, TIME-LIMITED PARTS, in this manual. </p>
