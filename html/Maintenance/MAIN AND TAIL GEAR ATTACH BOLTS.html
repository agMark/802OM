    The bolts attaching the main and tail gear springs to the fuselage structure are among the most important structural
    components of the aircraft. Being structural components under constant stress, these bolts have definite fatigue
    lives. The predictability of the fatigue life of each bolt is impossible due to the wide variety of operating
    conditions that include smoothness of landing strips, number of landings per hour, pilot landing technique, load
    carried, the way the turns on the ground are made, the way the brakes are used, and many other small but significant
    factors. Dropping in over the trees and hitting the ground during a spray run may not cause a gear bolt failure, but
    the effect on the fatigue life of the bolt could be the same as several thousand landings on a rough strip. A bolt
    that is not tightened to the proper torque, especially when there is visible clearance between the gear spring and
    the fuselage, will last only a fraction of the time normally expected.
</p>

<p>
    We have established what we feel is a conservative, yet realistic time period for gear bolt changes, based on field
    experience at this time. The bolt life shown is based on normal operations. If you discover slack in the large 1
    1/8" bolt attaching the main gear leg, change it immediately.

<p>For the clamp bolts, if you are not also replacing the spring, you should be able to use bolts with the same length.  Contact Air Tractor customer service for advice and parts.</p>


<p><b>Main Gear Axle Attach Bolts</b></p>
