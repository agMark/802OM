    <b><u>Rigging Instructions:</u></b>

<p>Complete these instructions on both sides of the aircraft simultaneously.</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Lock the flight control stick in the neutral position using the cockpit control lock.  Confirm the ailerons are in the neutral position</li>

    <li>Check the position of the clamp that supports the two idler arms.  This clamp should be 10.0 (+/-Â½) inches from the interface of the longeron and diagonal tube.  See figure 1.  If necessary, loosen the clamp, adjust it within this range, and retighten hardware.</li>

    <li>Check the position of each centering spring.  Ensue that the Adel clamp anchoring each spring is located at a position of 8-3/4 (+/- 1/16) inches from the center of the clamp.  See figure 1.  Adjust the position of the Adel clamps if necessary. </li>

    <li>Ensure that the lower centering spring is connected to the inboard idler arm and the upper centering spring is connected to the outboard idler arm. </li>

    <li>Ensure that the 70814-4 interconnect spring is connected to the top hole of the outboard idler arm. </li>

    <li>Ensure that the 70525 interconnect cable is connected to the inboard idler arm.  The position of this cable attachment varies with the serial number of the aircraft.  See figure 1. 

    <p>For serial Numbers -0001 thru -0073, -0075, and -0076: the cable should attach to the top hole in the inboard idler arm (approx. 3/8 from the end).</p>

    For Serial Numbers -0074, and -0077 & subsequent:  the cable should attach to the second hole in the inboard idler arm (approx. 1 3/8 from the end). 

    </li>

    <li>Manually center the rudder and hold in place. </li>

    <li>Visually ensure that the rudder pedals are even in the cockpit.  Adjust if needed. </li>

    <li>Measure the horizontal spread of the idler arms as shown in figure 1.  This dimension should measure between 1-3/4 and 1-7/8 inches.  In addition, both sides must match within 1/16 inches. </li>

    <li>If necessary to match the dimension stated in Step 9, adjust the turnbuckles on the cables.  See Figure 2.  After adjusting, safety the turnbuckles with MS20995C32 wire (Reference:  FAA Advisory Circular 43.13-1B). </li>

    <li>Check the cable routing for pulleys that are out of alignment and for cable contact with any structure.  Check the cables for any damage or wear that would necessitate replacement (Reference: FAA Advisory Circular 43.13-1B). </li>

    <li>Ensure that all hardware is tight and properly installed. </li>

    <li>Unlock the controls and move the rudder pedals and aileron controls through their full range of motion.  Check for any binding or sticking of controls.  Applying full righthand rudder input should result in a tendency for the righthand aileron to rise and applying full lefthand rudder input should result in a tendency for the lefthand aileron to rise. </li>
