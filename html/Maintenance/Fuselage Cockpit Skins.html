<p>The cockpit metal skins are riveted to the floor and to the support angles with MS20470AD4 rivets. Attachments to the door frames are CR9163-4-2 Cherry rivets. The cockpit skins may be removed by drilling out the rivets where necessary and is not a difficult operation. The hopper should be removed in order to remove the cockpit floor however. </p>

<p>The upper aft side of the hopper tank forms the forward wall of the cockpit. This portion of the cockpit enclosure is integral with the hopper tank, so maintenance concerning the hopper is addressed in Section 2, HOPPERS. </p>
