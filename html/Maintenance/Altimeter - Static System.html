    The static port on the AT-802 is contained within the wing-mounted pitot head. The static system on this airplane can
    be drained by opening the static line inside the leading edge of the wing. Alternatively, the line can be blown out
    with compressed air. In this case, the static line is accessible beneath the right-hand fuselage skin that attaches
    to the top of the hopper tank.

    <p class='boxCautionMediumHeader'>CAUTION</p>
    <p class='boxCautionMediumText'>Apply air pressure only to the line that leads to the pitot-static head. Do not apply
        air pressure to the line that leads to the instrument panel. Sensitive instruments may be damaged.</p>
</div>

<p>
    The static ports on the AT-802A are the low points of the system and are normally self-draining. There are “T"
    fittings on the rear face of the static port buttons. The downward-facing arm of the “T" fittings are plugged. These
    plugs must be removed to drain residual moisture in the static-system lines.

<p><b>Pitot/Static Calibration </b></p>
<p>
    The Altimeter uses a density altitude and compares the pressure to a measured static pressure from the static port.
    Static system needs to be tested for the transponder to provide correct altitude.</p>
<p>
    Using Pitot Static tester attach positive pressure line to pitot tube and negative pressure line to static port.
    Pitot
    tube on the AT-802A is under the left hand wing. For the two seater AT-802-2, the pitot and static probe is in the
    leading edge of the left hand wing.
    The probe on the AT-802-2 will require and adapter to connect vacuum port. 
    To maintain compliance with part 91.411,
    use Appendix E to part 43 which outlines the procedures for performing the altimeter systems test and inspection for the transponder.
