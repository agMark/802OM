<p>
    The static port on the AT-802 is contained within the wing-mounted pitot head while the static ports on AT-802A are located in the aft section of the fuselage. For AT-802s the static system on this airplane can
    be drained by opening the static line inside the leading edge of the wing.  For AT-802As, the static line is accessible beneath the right-hand fuselage skin that attaches
    to the top of the hopper tank.

    <p class='boxCautionMediumHeader'>CAUTION</p>
    <p class='boxCautionMediumText'>Apply air pressure only to the line that leads to the pitot-static head. Do not apply
        air pressure to the line that leads to the instrument panel. Sensitive instruments may be damaged.</p>
</div>

<p>
    The static ports on the AT-802A are the low points of the system and are normally self-draining but there are plugged  â€œT" fittings on the rear face of the static port buttons in the aft fuselage. These plugs can be removed to drain residual moisture in the static-system lines.

<p><b>Pitot/Static Calibration </b></p>

<p>
    Using Pitot Static tester attach positive pressure line to pitot tube and negative pressure line to static port.
    Pitot
    tube on the AT-802A is under the left hand wing. For the two seater AT-802-2, the pitot and static probes are both in the boom installed on the
    leading edge of the left hand wing.
    The probe on the AT-802-2 will require an adapter to connect vacuum port. 
    To maintain compliance with part 91.411,
    use Appendix E to part 43 which outlines the procedures for performing the altimeter systems test and inspection for the transponder.
