    <p><b>Pitot/Static Calibration    </b></p>
    <p>The Altimeter uses a density altitude and compares the pressure to a measured static pressure from the static port. Static
        system needs to be tested for transponder to provide correct altitude.</p>
    <p>Using Pitot Static tester attach positive pressure line to pitot tube and negative pressure line to static port. Pitot
     tube on the AT-802A is under the left hand wing. For the two seater AT-802-2, the pitot and static probe is in the leading edge of the left hand wing.
     The probe on the AT-802-2 will require and adapter to connect vacuum port. To maintain compliance with part 91.411, use Appendix
     E to part 43 outlines the procedures for performing the altimeter systems test and inspection for the transponder. </p>
