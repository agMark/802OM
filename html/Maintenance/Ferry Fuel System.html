<p>
    The ferry fuel system utilizes the hopper as a fuel tank (see <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_22.png" xrefType="link">Fig
        Cross Reference</xref>) and is not an FAA Certificated fuel system. However, it may be installed provided a
    logbook entry is made for both the installation and removal.
</p>

<p>
    Great care must be taken to ensure that the ferry fuel system is installed and removed properly and that
    contaminants are not introduced into the fuel system.
</p>



<p>
    The ferry fuel system should be installed per Drawing 50280, Sheet 1 in firefighting aircraft and 50280, Sheet 3 for
    agricultural aircraft. The installation and removal of the ferry fuel system may be done in accordance with these
    drawings or in accordance with the instructions provided in this section which are provided here for convenience.
