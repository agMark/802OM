    <p>All Air Tractors are equipped with a magnetic wet compass.  Fluid may leak or evaporate.  Periodically check the fluid level to ensure proper operation.</p>

    <p><b>Compass Calibration</b></p>
    <p>Air Tractor suggests performing a magnetic compass calibration, or swing, any time welding is performed on the airplane, especially welding inside the cockpit.</p>
    <p>For detailed instruction on performing a compass swing, refer to FAA Advisory Circular 43-215.</p>


    <p>For any item of equipment that causes a compass deviation of greater than 10 degrees, investigate the equipment to determine if changes to the wire routing or shielding can be made to reduce the effect.</p>

    <p>If the deviation is not able to be reduced below 10 degrees, then a placard should be made and placed near the magnetic compass per 14 CFR 23.1547(e). </p>
