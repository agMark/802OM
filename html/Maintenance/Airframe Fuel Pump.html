<p>The CECO airframe pump has a pressure adjustment that has been set at the factory for approximately 20 psi with the engine operating at 80% power.  The Parker 3B7-31 pump's pressure is not adjustable. If a new pump is installed, and if a negative pressure is read after engine start-up, it is a sign that the airframe pump is not set up for proper rotation, and the body of the pump can be removed and rotated 180Â° to obtain a positive reading. The engine manufacturer requires that a minimum pressure of 5 psi is being delivered to the fuel control at all times, with a maximum pressure of 20 psi. A negative pressure switch and warning light has been installed on the outlet side of the fuel filter. If the fuel filter warn light comes on, the electric fuel boost pump should be turned on. The pilot should land as soon as possible and investigate. Possible cause would be a contaminated fuel filter. When the light comes on it is an indication that fuel flow is restricted between the exit side of the filter and the tanks. </p>

<p>Aircraft equipped with a Parker 3B7-31 electric fuel boost pump installed should be checked for undesired movement. Due to variability in the NAS1716D42T band clamps, some of the clamps used to install the Parker electric fuel boost pumps may not be tight enough to keep the pump from sliding out of a clamp. Checking for this condition can be done by attempting to slide the pump by hand. If the pump can slide within the clamps while applying a small amount of force, then the corrective action described in Service Letter #401 is recommended. The ability to rotate the pump within the clamps while applying a small or moderate rotation force is normal and does not warrant corrective action.</p>
