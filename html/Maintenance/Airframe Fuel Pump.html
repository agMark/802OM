<p>The airframe pump has a pressure adjustment that has been set at the factory for approximately 20 psi with the engine operating at 80% power. If a new airframe pump is installed, and if a negative pressure is read after engine start-up, it is a sign that the airframe pump is not set up for proper rotation, and the body of the pump can be removed and rotated 180Â° to obtain a positive reading. The engine manufacturer requires that a minimum pressure of 5 psi is being delivered to the fuel control at all times, with a maximum pressure of 20 psi. A negative pressure switch and warn light has been installed on the outlet side of the fuel filter. If the fuel filter warn light comes on, the electric fuel boost pump should be turned on. The pilot should land as soon as possible and investigate. Possible cause would be a contaminated fuel filter. When the light comes on it is an indication that fuel flow is restricted between the exit side of the filter and the tanks. </p>
