<p>Air Tractor recognizes that owners often want or need to modify their airplanes to fit their needs. Many of the modifications are items of equipment offered from the factory, or equipment that is offered in the aftermarket. When looking to modify your plane, you should be reminded that modifications to an airplane must have an appropriate airworthiness approval. The US FAA formally calls modifications "alterations" and places them in two categories; minor alterations and major alterations. In general, any alterations must have approved data. In some minor alteration cases acceptable data is all that is required. </p>
