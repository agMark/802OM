<p>Engine build-up consists of removing the components and accessories from the engine being removed and installing them on the replacement engine. It is recommended to replace all gaskets, packings, and/or O-rings during reassembly. For accessory drive gaskets, refer to the appropriate Pratt & Whitney Engine Illustrated Parts Catalog. </p>

<p>The following components may require installation on replacement engine. Refer to Figure 1 below for engine accessory drive pad locations. </p>

<p><u>Engine Provided Accessories:</u> Refer to the appropriate Pratt & Whitney Engine Maintenance Manual for Removal/Installation Instructions.</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Install engine mounts/Vibration isolators on engine mount pads. Install grounding strap isolator mounting bolt. Torque mounting hardware supplied with isolator to 185 - 225 in-lbs. and safety wire. </li>
    <li>Install Np tach generator on engine RGB drive (Pad 8) with gasket. Lubricate generator coupling and spline shift with turbine engine oil. Torque nuts to 50 in-lbs. </li>
    <li>Install Ng tach generator on engine AGB drive (Pad 3). Lubricate generator coupling and spline shaft with turbine engine oil and replace gasket. Torque nuts to 50 in-lbs. </li>
    <li>Install overspeed governor on engine RGB drive (Pad 9). Lubricate spline of governor with turbine engine oil and rotate propeller shaft to align the spline shaft. Replace gasket and torque nuts to 50 in-lbs. </li>
    <li>Install oil pressure port restrictor fitting P/N: 50554-1 with new AS3209-213 O-ring on engine “LP1" oil pressure port. Lubricate O-ring and threads of restrictor fitting with turbine engine oil. </li>
    <li>Install oil temperature sender. </li>
    <li>Install engine driven (low pressure) fuel pump on engine AGB drive (Pad 4). Lubricate spline of fuel pump with turbine engine oil. Rotate starter drive gear shaft to align splines. Torque mounting hardware to 50 in-lbs. </li>
    <li>Install starter generator QAD mount to engine AGB drive (Pad 1) with one of the three dowel pins located in the same position as the one removed.  No gasket is required. Torque nuts to 100 in-lbs. </li>
    <li>Install air conditioner drive pad assembly on engine AGB drive (Pad 5) with blank drive pad cover over lower mount pad (Pad 6). If AGB gear shaft is a dry (or misting lube) drive, lubricate drive spline and completely fill gear shaft cavity with molydisulfide grease.  If AGB gear shaft is a sealed wet spline as evidenced by an O-ring of the air conditioning drive spline and hollow AGB gear shaft, no lubrication is required (except the O-ring). Torque mounting bolts to 50 in-lbs and safety wire. </li>
    <li>Install FCU lever input arm on engine-cam box at marked location with the FCU control linkage at the track point on the cam.   Torque nut 100 to 120 in-lbs. </li>
    <li>Install fuel flow transducer by removing inline adaptor fitting and installing transducer in place of adaptor. Note “K" factor printed on transducer. </li>
