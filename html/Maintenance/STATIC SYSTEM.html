<p>The static port on the AT-802 is contained within the wing-mounted pitot head. The static system on this airplane can be drained by opening the static line inside the leading edge of the wing. Alternatively, the line can be blown out with compressed air. In this case, the static line is accessible beneath the right-hand fuselage skin that attaches to the top of the hopper tank.  </p>

    <p class=‘boxCautionLargeHeader’>CAUTION</p>
    <p class=‘boxCautionLargeText’>Apply air pressure only to the line that leads to the pitot-static head. Do not apply air pressure to the line that leads to the instrument panel. Sensitive instruments may be damaged.</p>

<p>The static ports on the AT-802A are the low points of the system and are normally self-draining. There are “T” fittings on the rear face of the static port buttons. The downward-facing arm of the “T” fittings are plugged. These plugs must be removed to drain residual moisture in the static-system lines. </p>
