<p>The plumbing from the hopper gate box to the spray pump consists of a p/n 80385-4 tube assembly and an 80376-1 hose attached to the 80385-4 tube. The hose is clamped with QS200M56S clamps which are entirely stainless. </p>

<p>The plumbing from the discharge side of the pump to the valve is p/n 80636-1 and has a p/n 80743-2 coupler at the valve end. The hoses are p/n 80399-1 and are double clamped with QS200M48S clamps. In addition a QS200M36S clamp is attached to the 80636-1 tube just outboard of the hose at the pump and p/n 80655-1 strap is used to safety the clamp to the top of the pump to prevent the 80636-1 tube from blowing off due to high pressure and water hammer effects. </p>

<p>The tube attaching to the strainer is p/n 80637-1 assembly (2 ea.). The straps on the support assemblies are p/n 80383-1 and are attached with AN4C6A bolts. D4-13T-303 Faspins are used to attach the support assemblies to the fuselage frame. </p>

<p>For aircraft that has the digital hopper quantity display (manufactured by Amtech Manufacturing, Inc.) installed:</p>

<p>In some operations, high-volume spray work and/or rapid spray valve operation can cause hydraulic shock in the spray system. This shock, otherwise known as “water hammer” can cause a pressure spike that can damage the pressure sensor. A small, inexpensive orifice can be installed to help isolate the pressure sensor from this pressure spike and prevent the sensor from being damaged. This orifice may be retrofitted to your aircraft using the instructions found in Service Letter #308.</p>
