<p>Prior to installing the starter generator, verify:</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>
        There are no burrs or foreign objects on the starter-generator shaft.
    </li>
    <li>
        The starter-generator guide pins are clean and not bent or damaged.
    </li>
    <li>
        The mounting surfaces of the starter-generator and the QAD pad are clean and 
        free of burrs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The QAD pad is properly secured to the engine.  Check for at least 1 full thread protruding through the QAD nuts.  Use AN960-516L skinny washers instead of supplied MS9321-11 washers supplied with the engine if required. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The QAD pad guide pin holes are free of burrs, foreign objects and in good 
        condition.
    </li>
    <li>
        For wet spline starter-generators check 'O' ring on drive shaft to see if it is worn 
        or cut. Replace if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drive shaft is concentric to the armature of the starter-generator. If 
        the drive shaft appears to be out of position, lightly tap on the drive shaft spline, 
        using a soft faced mallet to move it back into full concentric position.

</ol>

<p>To install the starter generator:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        One mechanic is to gently align the starter-generator to the QAD pad, being 
        careful not to put the starter-generator drive spline in a bind.
    </li>
    <li>
        After the starter-generator has been properly aligned, one mechanic should hold 
        the unit in position by keeping the starter generator mounting surfaces flush with
        the QAD pad while the other mechanic installs and secures the 'V' band clamp
        (note the installation torque on clamp ring).
    </li>
    <li>
        While tightening the nut on the T-bolt to its recommended torque value, tap 
        around the circumference of the clamp ring with a soft faced hammer
        to position the clamp firmly on the generator.
    </li>
    <li>
        The recommended torque value for the clamp is stamped on the clamp ring.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reconnect cables.
    </li>
</ol>
