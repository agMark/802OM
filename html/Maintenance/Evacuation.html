<p>Evacuation is the process of removing air and moisture from the refrigeration system before charging the
    system with
    refrigerant. Air or moisture remaining in the system before and during the refrigerant charge process will
    cause
    increased pressures during operation resulting in reduced or poor cooling and greatly reduce the compressor
    life.</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Explanation of Evacuation</li>
    <p>As vacuum is increased the temperature at which water boils drops. As the water/moisture boils its vapor
        can be
        drawn out of the system by the vacuum pump. It is recommended to perform the evacuation process in a
        warm area. The
        vehicle engine can also be run in order to warm up the components of the air conditioning system to
        enhance the
        evacuation process.</p>

    <p>Allow the vacuum pump to run for 30 minutes drawing down near to 30” Hg. After 30 minutes of evacuation
        close the
        service valves and turn off the pump. Let the system sit for 10 minutes, if vacuum loss of 2” or greater
        occurs
        there is probably a leak.</p>
    <p>Other reasons a vacuum cannot be held for 10 minutes after shut off:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flush was not completely removed from system before evacuation started.</li>
        <li>Refrigerant is trapped in refrigerant oil from previous charge.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Vacuum Pump Service</li>
    <p>Vacuum pumps not receiving regular service will be unable to draw an adequate vacuum. In most cases
        simple changing
        the pumps oil will correct the problem. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for any
        maintenance on
        your evacuation pump. Change the oil after use while the oil is still hot, because contaminants are
        still in
        suspension and will be removed with the oil. If contaminants cool, solidify and stay in the pump, they
        lower vacuum
        efficiency. In extreme cases, the oil stops lubricating and the pump seizes. The only way to determine
        oil condition
        is to test vacuum pulled with an electronic vacuum gauge. Contamination cannot be determined by oil
        color.</p>
