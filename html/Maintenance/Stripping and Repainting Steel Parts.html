<p>Steel parts are to be cleaned of all oils and then sand-blasted.  If sand-blasting is not available, clean the part thoroughly, wipe dry, sand, and etch with a mixture of 1.0 gal. Isopropyl Alcohol and 1/2 fluid oz. of concentrated Phosphoric acid.  If applying finish coat over bare metal, prime first with High Solids Epoxy Primer (see instructions above) and paint using Urethane Topcoat process (see instructions above).  </p>
