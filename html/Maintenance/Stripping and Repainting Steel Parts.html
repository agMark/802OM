<p>Steel parts are to be cleaned of all oils and then sand-blasted.  If sand-blasting is not available, clean the part thoroughly, wipe dry, sand, and etch with a mixture of 1.0 gal. Isopropyl Alcohol and 1/2 fluid oz. of concentrated Phosphoric acid.  If applying finish coat over bare metal, prime first with High Solids Epoxy Primer (see <xref sectionTarget="2.105.1" prependLabel="Section"></xref> above) and paint using Urethane Topcoat process (see <xref sectionTarget="2.105.1" prependLabel="Section"></xref> above).  </p>
