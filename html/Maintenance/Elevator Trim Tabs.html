<p>Details of the elevator trim tabs are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_69.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>.  The elevator trim tabs are p/n 30600-1 L/H, 30600-2 R/H and attach to the elevators with a p/n 30610-1 hinge that bolts in the inboard rib with AN3-5A bolts and AN960-10 washers. </p>

<p>Two p/n 70559-1 push-rods attach to the trim tab horn with AN3-7A bolts, AN365-1032 nuts and to the idler arm in the stabilizer with AN3-6 bolts, AN310-3 nuts, AN960-10 washers, MS24665-151 cotters. Be sure the push-rod is positioned with the bend on the fwd end approximately under the elevator spar tube. There is a Bunting P19-1 bushing at the forward joint, which should be replaced if the tab free play at the trailing edge exceeds .14 inches. If there is still excessive free play check the bolts for wear and check the push-rod ends for wear. Install new push-rods if the holes are worn. </p>

<p>The trim tabs are shimmed laterally with shims. Lateral free play should be between .050 and .020 in. To lubricate the tab bushings remove the #8 machine screw. Oil the bushings through the screw hole and at the end of the tab. Use general purpose oil for this. Replace the #8 oil hole plug screw. </p>
