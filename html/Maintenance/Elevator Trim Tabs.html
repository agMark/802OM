<p>The trim tabs are shimmed laterally with shims. Lateral free play should be between .050 and .020 in. To lubricate
    the tab bushings remove the #8 machine screw. Oil the bushings through the screw hole and at the end of the tab. Use
    general purpose oil for this. Replace the #8 oil hole plug screw. </p>

    See <xref sectionTarget="2.30.5" prependLabel="Section">Cross reference placeholder</xref> for maximum tab free play.
