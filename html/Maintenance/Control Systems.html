    Continuity of the aircraft flight control systems is one of the most important factors that affects safety of
    flight. A structural disconnect in the flight control systems can result in serious consequences including loss of
    control or aircraft instability. These situations can result in a potentially fatal crash or accident.
    Unfortunately, problems with flight control continuity can arise when an airplane is being modified or maintained.
    This could happen on a new airplane as it is being modified for final delivery to the customer, or when an airplane
    is undergoing maintenance.

    Inspecting the continuity of the aircraft flight control systems can be accomplished in a relatively short period of
    time and requires no special tools. Air Tractor strongly recommends that an inspection be performed to ensure
    control continuity and proper installation of control system hardware. This inspection should be performed before
    the first flight, when taking receipt of a new airplane or after an airplane has undergone any significant
    maintenance. Service Letter #340 can be used as an excellent guide to perform such inspections.
