        <ol type="1">
            <li>Completely retract the flaps to the 0° position.</li>

            <li>Disconnect the elevator down spring (p/n 70814-3 for single controls, p/n 70814-1 for dual controls) where it connects to the aft elevator controls idler.  This can be done with the flight control stick in the full forward position. </li>

            <li>After the spring is disconnected, lock the flight control stick in the neutral position using the cockpit control lock.  Conform the elevators are in the neutral position. </li>

            <li>Check the hole-to-hole length of the 70796-1 pushrod that connects the flap torque tube to the 70788-1 cable tensioner assembly.  This length should be 10-1/2 (+/-1/8) inches. </li>

            <li>Check the lateral placement of the 70788-1 cable tensioner assembly and the 70784-1 clamp arm.  The center of both of these assemblies should be 5-5/8 (+/- 1/16) inches to the left of the aircraft centerline.  Note that the lower aileron torque tube is centered on the aircraft centerline and can be used as the centerline reference for this measurement.  If required, adjust the tensioner assembly and the clamp arm to this dimension. </li>

            <li>Tighten the clamp bolts for the tensioner assembly to secure it in place.  Leave the clamp bolts on the 70784-1 clamp arm loose for now. </li>

            <li>Ensure the 70796-1 pushrod is installed, connecting the tensioner assembly and the clamp arm as shown above. </li>

            <li>Rotate the tensioner assembly to the 60° nominal angle shown below.  Note that the holes in the tensioner bearing can be used to “eyeball" this angle.  Allow the 70784-1 clamp arm to rotate on the flap torque tube as necessary.  When the tensioner is at the 60° angle, tighten the clamp arm bolts to secure the clamp arm to the flap torque tube. </li>

            <li>Reconnect the elevator control downspring to the aft elevator control idler.  With the flaps retracted and elevators neutral, the length of the downspring (excluding the hooks) should measure 20.0 (+/- 1/8) inches.  To adjust this length, adjust the length of the 70796-1 pushrod. </li>

            <li>After the initial downspring length is set, check the cable routing for pulleys that are out of alignment, cable contact with any structure. </li>

            <li>Ensure that all hardware is tight and all rodend checknuts are properly tightened. </li>

            <li>Actuate the flaps through their full range of motion and watch the cable tensioner and pushrod for any interference or binding. </li>
