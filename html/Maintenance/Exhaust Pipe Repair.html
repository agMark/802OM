<p>It is industry practice to remove dents in engine exhaust pipes during the annual inspection or when other repairs are being made. This would be for dents that are less than three inches in diameter and no more than one-half inch deep. This is because a dent of that size does not degrade engine performance. A large dent would be one greater than three inches in diameter and greater than three-fourths inch deep.</p>

<p>A large dent should be removed at the first opportunity to do maintenance on the aircraft, when flying slacks off and leaves a day to perform the work. To remove dents, first remove the exhaust pipe from the engine and clamp it in a vise or suitable holding fixture. Heat the dent with a rosebud tip in an acetylene torch until the pipe is just starting to turn red. It will be necessary to use a hammer inside the exhaust pipe so have the pipe positioned to allow this.</p>

<p>Prepare a rounded "dolly" similar to a rivet bucking bar with the rounded edge approximating the inside radius of the exhaust pipe. This is to be placed against the dent and struck with a hammer. To offer a backing to offset the hammer strikes, use a lead shot bag on the outside of the exhaust pipe, and over the
dent to be removed. To keep from melting the lead during heating, place a welder's glove between the lead shot bag and the dent. Wear a welder's glove and strike the "dolly" with a hammer and have the shot bag on the outside of the pipe. </p>

<p>Most dents can be removed this way. There will be creases or wrinkles after dent removal, but these are of no consequence.</p>
