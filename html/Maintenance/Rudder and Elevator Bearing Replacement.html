<p>The rudder and elevator both use MS14104-4 bearings to attach to the vertical and horizontal stabilizers.   These bearings will wear and out with time and will eventually require replacement.</p>

<p>With the rudder or elevator removed, the bearings should be checked for corrosion, free-play, and bolt looseness.</p>

<p>When new, the bearings have minimal free-play.  MS14104 shows maximum acceptable radial free play of 0.0007 in and maximum acceptable axial free play of .0028 in.  For bearings that have been in-service, the maximum allowable free play limits are:</p>

<table class="plainTableSmall">
    <tr>
        <th class="plainTableHeaderCell">Radial</th>
        <td class="plainTableNormalCell">.001 in</td>

    <tr>
        <th class="plainTableHeaderCell">Axial</th>
        <td class="plainTableNormalCell">.005 in</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<td>Freedom of movement should also be checked, starting torque must not exceed 15 in-lb.  Experience shows that a bearing that can be rotated by hand using only finger pressure will not exceed 8 in-lb of starting torque.</td>

<p>When replacement of these bearings is required, observe the staking pattern which will appear as indentations around the outer diameter of the bearing race.  The staking indentions must be removed in order to remove the bearing without further damaging the rib.  To do this, a small rotary tool is suggested to be used so as to remove a minimum amount of material.  Once staking indentations are sufficiently removed, proceed to cautiously press the bearing out of the bore.</p>

<p>Once the bearing is removed, inspect the bore for gouges and damage.  An oversized bore may require the use of an oversized repair bearing, contact Air Tractor Customer Service if this is the case.</p>

<p>If the bore is not damaged or oversized, proceed to install the new bearing as follows (from PS131):</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Verify that the housing bore is clean and free of burrs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Coat the bore surface with primer. Note: Zinc chromate primers have been used in the past, and are still acceptable. Duplicolor 
        DAP1690 Self-Etching Primer is also an approved primer in this role. Primer is sprayed into 
        a cup and then brushed into the bore of the hole. 
    </li>
    <li>
        While the primer paint is still wet press the bearing into the housing bore with an installation 
        tool that keeps the bearing square to the housing bore and applies a uniformly distributed 
        load around the perimeter of the bearing outer ring only. 
        Note: The bearing housing (plate) must be supported flat and perpendicular to the axis of the 
        bearing press motion close to the edge of the bore. Generally, an arbor press is used to press 
        the bearing into the housing bore.
    </li>
    <li>
        Press the bearing into the bore to a depth such that the 
        shoulders of the bearing inner ring are positioned equidistant from each side of the 
        housing plate.
        Note: The bore fit should not require excessive force or the bearing may bind after 
        installation. The bore must also not be so loose that the bearing can be inserted by hand.
    </li>
    <li>
         After bearing installation check the bearing for binding.  This will be repeated again after the bearing is staked.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stake the bearing in place.  Staking is a process of indenting the metal surrounding the bearing to impart radial pressure and mechanical interference with the chamfer of the bearing housing for retention.  Use of an appropriate staking die set is highly recommended.

            <figcaption class="centerText">Staking Die Set</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Staking points should be spaced out evenly and not within 20Â° of a previous indention.

    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect staking impressions.  They should not be large enough to cause binding but should secure the bearing axially.
    </li>
    <li>
        Check bearing axial and radial free play.  Free play should be negligible or not measureable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Check starting or breakout torque is less than 15 in-lb.  If needed, it is acceptable to run the bearing for a few minutes before re-testing the starting torque.
    </li>
