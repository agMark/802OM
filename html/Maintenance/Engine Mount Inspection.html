<p>Engine mount cracks are difficult to see during a routine inspection because they are located adjacent to the engine mount ring located inside the plenum. The locations of these cracks are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_2.80.8.1.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>.</p>

<p>These areas shown should be visually inspected by a certified mechanic. To perform the inspection, the following steps should be taken:</p>
<ol type=”1”>

               <li>Remove engine cowling and plenum covers.</li>
               <li>Inspect engine mount around all tubing clusters where they attach to the engine mount ring.</li>
               <li>Thoroughly check all around every cluster, using FAA Advisory Circular AC 43.13-1B, Chapter 5, Section 2 as a general guide for proper visual inspection techniques. </li>
               <li>After inspection, make a notation in aircraft logbooks to indicate that a visual inspection has been completed. </li>
