<p>Spray lever controls vary between AT-802 and AT-802A. Each is detailed here. </p>

<p><b>AT-802</b></p>

<p>Details of the spray-lever controls are shown in figure 62A. The p/n 82240-1 spray lever assembly is attached to the mid-cockpit frame tube and has an AG-235 micro-control attached to limit the lever travel and hence the spray pressure. Keep the threaded screw on the micro-control greased and make sure the tab on the spray lever contacts the bushing that is attached to the lower adjustment block. </p>

<p>The push-rod from the spray lever is p/n 82233-1 and has an adjustable Transland 44356 clevis in the lower end and a Fafnir REP4H6 in the upper end. The pushrod is attached to the bellcrank with an AN3-10A bolt. The clevis end fits a p/n 82237-1 spacer bushing that allows the bolt to be fully torqued.  </p>

<p>The lower bellcrank is attached to the fuselage with an AN4-25A bolt. The bellcrank has two Fafnir KP6A bearings with a p/n 70081-2 spacer bushing that allows the bolt to be fully torqued.  </p>

<p><b>For agricultural-only aircraft,</b> the bellcrank is p/n 82230-1 and has a p/n 80132-1 boot, 70140-1 boot ring attached to the lower fuselage skin with 90013-4 screws and MS21044C08 nuts. 
The push-rod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 81149-1 which has an NMB MS14104-4 bearing in each end. </p>

<p><b>For firefighting aircraft with an optional spray dispersal system,</b> the bellcrank is p/n 82236-1 and has a p/n 80132-1 boot, 70140-1 boot ring attached to the lower fuselage skin with 90013-4 screws and MS21044C08 nuts. </p>

<p>The push-rod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 80756-1 which has a Fafnir REP4H6 bearing in each end. </p>

<p><b>AT-802A</b></p>

<p>Details of the spray-lever controls are shown in figure 62. The p/n 80073-9 spray lever assembly is attached to the aft cockpit wall and has an AG-235 micro-control attached to limit the lever travel and hence the spray pressure. Keep the threaded screw on the micro-control greased and make sure the tab on the spray lever contacts only the head of the AN4-5A bolt that is attached to the lower adjustment block. </p>

<p>The push rod from the spray lever is p/n 80580-1 and has an adjustable Fafnir REP4M6 bearing in the lower end and a Fafnir REP4H6 bearing in the upper end. </p>

<p>The lower bellcrank is attached to the fuselage frame with an AN4-25A bolt. The bellcrank has two Fafnir KP6A bearings with a p/n 70081-2 spacer bushing that allows the bolt to be fully torqued. The bellcrank is p/n 80068-1 and has a p/n 80132-1 boot, 70140-1 boot ring attached to the lower fuselage skin with 90013-4 screws, MS21044C08 nuts. </p>

<p><b>For agricultural-only aircraft,</b> the pushrod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 80065-8 which has a NMB MS14104-4 bearing in each end. </p>

<p><b>For firefighting aircraft with an optional spray dispersal system,</b> the pushrod from the bellcrank to the valve is p/n 80756-1 which has a Fafnir REP4H6 bearing in each end. </p>

<p>The spray lever in the cockpit can be adjusted to personal preference by adjusting the Spray Handle Adjustment Bearing as shown in Figure 62. The procedures that may be followed for adjustment of the spray-lever position in the cockpit: </p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Remove the bolt that secures the adjustment bearing to the bellcrank.</li>
    <li>Loosen the check nut on the stem of the clevis.</li>
    <li>Secure the bellcrank to hold the spray valve in the SPRAY OFF position.</li>
    <li>Secure the cockpit spray handle in the desired position for SPRAY OFF.</li>
    <li>Adjust the clevis to align with the bolt holes in the bellcrank.</li>
    <li>Replace the bolt, washer (s), and nut and retighten the check nut.</li>
    <li>Check travel of spray handle in cockpit. If necessary, repeat steps 1 through 6 for best fit. </li>
