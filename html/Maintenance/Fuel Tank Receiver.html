<p>The schematic for the fuel-tank receiver is shown in Figure 28. </p>

<p>The fuel tank receiver is p/n 51274-1. There is an adjustment screw for the “E" side of the needle range on the center lower side of the instrument face. The trimmer screw for the “F" side of the needle range is remotely mounted behind the upper panel, just left of center. Since the slotted end of the trimmer screw is towards the aircraft bottom, it is possible to reach under the panel with a small screwdriver to reach the “F" trimmer screw. (Be sure the power is off). </p>

<p>To check the receiver settings, drain all the fuel from the aircraft and jack the tailwheel up onto a platform until the bottom of the wing tanks are level. Be sure parking brake is ON as the tail is quite high in this position. Sighting fore and aft along the tank bottom with the line of sight meeting the horizon is an easy way to determine when the bottom of the wing tanks are level. Level the wing tips by placing a barrel and boards under the low wing tiedown ring until both wing tips are on the horizon. </p>

<p>Remove the L/H fuel line from the tank and cap the L/H tank outlet and plug the line to isolate the two tanks. Set the needle on “E" with the adjust screw on the face of the receiver. Gradually add fuel to the R/H wing tank with the battery switch ON. The battery should be fully charged for this check. The receiver needle should start to move very slightly off the “E" mark after 2 gallons of fuel have entered the tank. To check the “F" mark, lower the tail wheel to the ground. Reconnect the plugged fuel lines and fittings. Fill both tanks completely full. Adjust the trimmer screws behind the panel until both tanks show “F". </p>
