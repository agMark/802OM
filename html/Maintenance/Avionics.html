<p>Optional radio equipment may include those listed in drawing 60616. Removal or replacement of any of the radios requires removal of applicable fasteners in accordance with their corresponding installation drawing as indicated on drawing 60616.  All fasteners must be routinely inspected for tightness.  Antennas must be routinely inspected for secure attachment to the aircraft and structural integrity.  Routine cleaning of the avionics box and its components may be done by wiping with a damp cloth.  Ventilation openings in equipment housings should be open and free from obstructing lint and dust.  For further information on testing, adjustment, troubleshooting and repairs of the electronic equipment and systems, refer to the manufacturer's maintenance instructions, manuals and the applicable Federal Aviation Regulations. â€¯ Additional avionics maintenance information is found in FAA AC 43.13-1B Chapter 11, 12 and 15. </p>

<p>Electrical power to the radios is controlled by a circuit breaker switch located on the radio box.  Power is then distributed to each avionics component which is protected by an adequately rated circuit breaker located on the radio box or in the lower panel.  Wiring schematics specific to each avionics component may be obtained from manufacturer's data.  These schematics are found in the figures section of the manual.</p>
