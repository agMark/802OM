<p>Details of the elevator controls are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_68.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>.  The aft elevator push-rod that connects to the elevator horns is p/n 70522-1 and is adjustable on the forward end, which has a Fafnir RE4M6 bearing installed. The aft end of the push-rod has a NMB p/n MS1404-4 bearing same as the elevators and rudder and is pressed into place and staked just as in other applications. If it is to be removed, see <xref fileTarget="html/Maintenance/Rudder and Elevator Bearing Replacement.html" xrefType="link", prependLabel="Section"></xref>.</p>

<p>
    Due to dynamic forces at airspeeds above 140 mph, some aircraft may develop an oscillation about the pitch axis if flown with hands off the control stick, and rough air is encountered. Full control of the aircraft is accomplished by hands on the control stick, which will stop the oscillation.
    The factory has determined that by adding a small amount of friction in the elevator control system, the oscillation is damped with hands off the control stick. 
</p>

<p>A friction device has been designed which bolts to the fuselage frame at the support bracket for the p/n 70117-1 elevator idler. This device is shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_68A.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. Friction is achieved by the clamping action about the elevator idler housing.  </p>

<p>If at any time an oscillation is noted when the aircraft is flown hands off, the clamping action of the friction device should be increased. This is accomplished by tightening the bolt as shown above in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_68A.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. It is called a â€œdamper" and is mounted per drawing 71335. </p>

<p>To measure the amount of friction required conduct the following procedure: </p>

<ol type='1'>
    <li>Remove the 71340-1 bolt that attaches the damper to the support bracket for the p/n 70117-1 or -7 elevator idler. </li>
    <li>Wrap a piece of safety wire around the top of the control stick just above the trigger and hook a small fish scale to the safety wire on the aft side of the stick grip.</li>
    <li>Measure the pounds of force required to move the control stick from the full forward position to the elevators neutral position. Flaps should be retracted.</li>
    <li>Now reinstall the damper to the support bracket.</li>
    <li>Tighten the bolt as required to provide a small amount of friction. Attach the fish scale to the control stick and determine the force required to move the stick from the full forward position to the elevators neutral as in step #3.</li>
    <li>The <u>additional</u> force should be at least 1.0 lbs, but not more than 3.0 lbs.</li>
</ol>
