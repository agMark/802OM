<p>Compressor lubrication occurs as the oil which circulates with the refrigerant passes through the
    compressor
    crankcase during operation. The Sanden SD series compressor achieves optimal durability and cooling
    performance when
    oil circulates through the system at a ratio of 3.3% to 8% oil to refrigerant. Excess oil can act as
    an insulator
    limiting heat transfer in the evaporator and condenser, while too little oil can negatively affect
    durability.</p>

<p>Oil circulates with the refrigerant during operation. During off periods oil will settle in all
    system components
    with more collecting in cool components like evaporators, accumulator and suction lines.</p>

<p>Oil checking is not required under normal conditions because it is a closed loop system, hence it is not necessary to
    check or change oil in systems
    functioning normally and not in need of repair. The system isolates the oil and refrigerant from
    moisture and
    contaminants, while normal operating temperatures will be well below a point that will cause oil
    degradation.</p>

<p>When Oil Addition or Balancing is required:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Compressor or component replacement</li>
    <li>Loss of refrigerant and oil mixture</li>
    <li>Adding oil to the system is required when refrigerant loss occurs due to leakage at any system
        component. Since oil
        is held in suspension with the refrigerant, oil will be lost with the escaping refrigerant gas.
        Oil will need to be
        inspected for contamination during repairs to determine if flushing is required.</li>
</ul>


<p class="dontBreakAfter"><b>Flushed System or New Systems</b></p>
<p>Systems which have no oil in them due to flushing or the system is being built from new components will require oil
    amounts in accordance with <xref fileTarget="html/Maintenance/Approved Oil and Refrigerants.html" xrefType="link", prependLabel="Section"></xref>.</p>



<p class="dontBreakAfter"><b>Compressor Swap, No Flushing</p></b>
<p>The goal of this procedure is to measure the oil amount in the failed compressor and adjust the amount in the new
    compressor to equal that of the failed. </p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Remove the oil plug from the failed compressor and drain as much oil as possible into a suitable container.</li>
    <li>Drain oil from the suction and discharge ports into a suitable container while turning the shaft clockwise only
        with a socket wrench on the armature retaining nut, as seen below in <xref fileTarget="img_AirCondionerCompressorDraining.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>.

    </li>
    <li>Measure and record the amount of oil drained from the compressor.</li>
    <li>Drain oil from the new compressor.</li>
    <li>Add oil back into the new compressor in an amount equal to that drained from the old compressor, as shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_AirConditionerAddingOilToCompressor.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>.

    </li>
    <li>Re-install oil plug. Seal and O-ring must be clean and not damaged. Torque to 11-15 ft•lb. Be careful not to
        cross thread the oil plug.</li>

<p>When replacing a system component the goal is to restore to the original factory oil amount. Use the
