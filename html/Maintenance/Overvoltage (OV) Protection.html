<p>In the event that system faults occur, either internal or external to the GCU, that results in over excitation of the S/G the OV circuit will prevent the Bus voltage from going above approximately 32 volts. This protection is accomplished by a â€œCrowbar" circuit in the GCU, which internally shorts pin J to D. This results in immediate removal of voltage from the S/G field and the LCR coil. At the same time high current flow through the 15A C/B causing it to trip. The OV Circuit has a time delay to prevent nuisance trips due to system transients. </p>
