<p>For serial numbers -0001 through -0007, the fuel valve which is located in the lower fuselage area below the cockpit is either a Hallett valve or an Aero Supply valve. They are very similar in appearance, but the Hallett valves have the name HALLETT embossed on the lower side of the valve.</p>

<p>The Aero Supply cam is of a much tougher material, is thicker, and is attached to the shaft with splines and a roll pin. We feel that the Aero Supply cam offers much more resistance to failure than does the Hallett cam. If your aircraft is equipped with a Hallett fuel valve the factory will replace it with an Aero Supply fuel valve per Service Letter #154.</p>
