<p>The wiring schematic for the Engine Overspeed Solenoid is shown in Figure 36. The function of this solenoid is to switch the hydraulic propeller-control circuit from variable RPM to fixed RPM in the event of governor failure. When activated, this circuit maintains propeller RPM to 30-to-60 RPM below the engine's maximum of 1700 RPM. </p>
