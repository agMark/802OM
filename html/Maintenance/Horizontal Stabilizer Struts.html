    The stabilizer struts attach to the fuselage frame with an AN6C13A bolt and to the stabilizer eyebolts with AN6-11A
    bolts.
    There are two eyebolts that attach to a welded steel brace inside the stabilizer for strut attachment. Eyebolt hardware replacement should be in accordance with SL 129, SL129A, SL129B and  <xref sectionTarget="2.200.1" prependLabel="Section"></xref>.

    The struts are constructed of 2.36 X 1.00 X .0494130N streamlined tubing and may be repaired if necessary. Check the
    factory for instructions since an internal tube is installed. They are oiled internally through the threaded
    fittings on the ends, and should be re-oiled if repaired. They are sand-blasted and given a baked powdered coating
    for abrasion resistance. At various intervals, the struts should be re-sand-blasted and finished as called out
    above. Be sure to remove the terminals and plug the open holes before sand-blasting.

    The stabilizer struts' leading edges are typically protected with 3M 8671-3 anti-abrasion tape. Thicker protection
    tape or material should not be installed as damage can occur (ref SL409 and SL383). The tape should be periodically
    inspected for condition and replaced as required.
