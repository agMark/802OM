<p>The wiring schematic for the windshield washer is shown in Figure 38 below. When the switch is closed, the pump's motor starts and the solenoid valve is opened. The flow of windshield-washing fluid will continue until the switch it released. The purpose of the solenoid is to provide a sharp cut-off of fluid when the switch is released. This prevents the dribbling of fluid into the windshield. </p>
