<b>Windshield Washer</b>

<p>The wiring schematic for the windshield washer is shown in Figure 38. When the switch is closed, the pumpâ€™s motor starts and the solenoid valve is opened. The flow of windshield-washing fluid will continue until the switch it released. The purpose of the solenoid is to provide a sharp cut-off of fluid when the switch is released. This prevents the dribbling of fluid into the windshield. </p>
