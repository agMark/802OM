<p>Refer to the appropriate FRDS Maintenance Manual for service information on the FRDS. </p>

<p>All aircraft with the FRDS 70588 Emergency Dump installation may have trapped pressure that causes the cockpit mounted E-Dump pressure gauge to give misleading information. This cause has been determined to be a redundant check valve that was installed as a precaution and has no impact on the proper operation of the redundant E-Dump system functions. Refer to Service Letter #351 to correct the incorrect gauge reading.</p>
