<p>(Nomenclature: S/G-Starter Generator, GCU-Generator Control Unit, LCR-Line Contact Relay, LV-Low Voltage, VM-Volt meter) </p>

<p>Starting: Actuating the Start Switch energizes the Start Relay, which applies battery voltage to term C of the S/G. This operates as a series wound DC motor. Note that at the same time battery voltage is applied to pin N of the GCU which signals it to remove field excitation from the S/G. The purpose of this feature is to prevent the poor start performance that would otherwise result if the Generator Switch were left in the ON position. </p>

    <p class=”boxCautionLargeHeader”>Note</p>
    <p class=”boxCautionLargeText”>It is recommended that the Generator Switch be in the OFF position during START because the high inrush current to the batteries immediately upon Start termination will result in higher than normal gas temperature (ITT). It is better to allow the engine to stabilize at Ground Idle before turning the Generator Switch ON.</p>
