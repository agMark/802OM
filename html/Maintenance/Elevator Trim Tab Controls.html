<p>Details of the elevator trim tab controls are shown in <xref fileTarget="img_ElevatorTrimControls.png">Cross
        Reference Placeholder</xref>. The elevator trim tab system uses the elevator tabs as both trim tabs and as
    elevator boost tabs. The boost tabs function to relieve a portion of the control load during maneuvers. </p>

<p>Elevator trim is controlled by a handwheel on the left-hand wall of the cockpit. The handwheel is shaft-connected to
    a two-sheave drum that drives two taut and opposing cables. These are connected at their opposite end to a pulley
    shaft that positions a worm gear in a gear box that is located in the aft fuselage. The worm-gear box is shown below
    in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_18.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. </p>

<p>The worm gear drives a sector gear with an exposed sector arm attached on the aft side of the gatebox. The sector arm
    is connected by a pushrod to a bellcrank that transmits the motion to an idler just forward of the aft edge of the
    horizontal stabilizer. One of these idlers is shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_70.png" xrefType="link">Fig
        Cross Reference</xref>. </p>

<p>Service Letter #300 describes that
    a fatigue crack in the weld on P/N: 70857-1 elevator trim actuator attach clamp assembly was found, most likely
    caused by elevator trim system binding due to lack of lubrication of the elevator trim / boost tab bushings. An
    improved attach clamp has been incorporated into the assembly line starting with serial number -0417 and is
    available for retrofit in earlier aircraft.</p>

<p>The bellcrank has output arms on both the right and left ends. Each of these ends connects to an idler in each of the
    horizontal stabilizers. Motion is then transmitted via dual control pushrods to the control horns of the elevator
    tabs on both sides of the airplane. The worm-and-sector arrangement allows the selected position of the tab to be
    maintained by sliding-face friction between the worm gear and the gear sector. If the trim tabs creep in flight,
    rework the friction bellville washers as detailed in SIL 802-0043. </p>

<p>A p/n 70742-1 trim bellcrank is attached to the fuselage frame with AN3-14A bolts, Bunting P26-8 bushings, p/n
    70065-1 spacer bushings, AN365-1032 nuts, and AN960-10 washers under the nuts. The bellcrank should be removed
    during 12-month inspections and the bushings inspected for wear and lubricated. </p>

<p>The push-rods from the trim bellcrank to the idler arm on the stabilizer rear spar are p/n 70532-1 and are
    adjustable. The ends are AN485-4 clevis ends with AN316-4 check nuts Attachments are with AN3-6 bolts, AN310-3 nuts,
    AN960-10 washers, and MS24665-151 cotters. The push-rods going forward from the bellcrank is p/n 70756-1 and has a
    Fafnir REB3N bearing attached to the bellcrank with a AN3-7A bolt, AN970-3 washer under the bolt head, AN960-10L
    washer under the AN365-1032 nut. </p>

<p>Fairleads are p/n 70122-1 with 40081-00 snap rings. The forward end going into the cockpit connects to the top hole
    in the trim lever with the same hardware as connecting to the trim bellcrank. </p>

<p>
    Two p/n 70559-1 push-rods attach to the trim tab horn with AN3-7A bolts, AN365-1032 nuts and to the idler arm in the
    stabilizer with AN3-6 bolts, AN310-3 nuts, AN960-10 washers, MS24665-151 cotters. Be sure the push-rod is positioned
    with the bend on the fwd end approximately under the elevator spar tube. There is a Bunting P19-1 bushing at the
    forward joint, which should be replaced if the tab free play is excessive. If there is
    still excessive free play check the bolts for wear and check the push-rod ends for wear. Install new push-rods if
    the holes are worn.
</p>

<p><b>Maximum Tab Free Play</b></p>
<p>
    In order to avoid the possibility of control surface flutter, the tab must not have excessive free play.
</p>
<p>
    For the AT-802 elevator trim tab, the maximum free play, which includes all bearing free play in the control system,
    is 0.14 in.  To measure free play, a dial indicator should measure the movement of  trailing edge of the trim tab.
