<p>Your Air Tractor is equipped with an electric fuel boost pump and an engine driven low pressure fuel pump. The electric boost pump is installed as a back-up for the engine driven low pressure pump. It also fills the fuel lines prior to starting. It can provide fuel to the high pressure pump that requires a minimum of 5 psi at all times for increased service life. The high-pressure pump alone can keep the engine running normally. </p>

<p>The AT-802/802A has a negative pressure switch and warning light with the switch on the outlet side of the fuel filter. If this warning light should come on, turn on the electric boost pump and have the problem corrected promptly. A check of the fuel filters is in order here, as one may be starting to clog because of the fuel contamination. Refer to Figure 48 and your Engine Maintenance Manual for details on cleaning the filters. The wiring schematic for this negative-pressure warning light is shown below. In this figure, the light is marked FUEL FILTER PRESS SW. </p>
