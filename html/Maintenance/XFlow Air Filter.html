    The 53474-1 filter assemblies are comprised of a cotton gauze element which 
    is enclosed within stainless steel mesh. The 53474-1 filter assemblies are visually 
    distinguishable from all other Air Tractor air filters by the blue molding.

<p>
    To ensure proper function, the filter assembly must be cleaned and maintained regularly. The 
    cotton gauze element is designed to efficiently separate particulates, dust and contaminates. 
    The element must be properly oiled to ensure optimum performance. 
</p>

<p>The filter assembly must be cleaned and re-oiled at least every 12 months or sooner if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the AIR FILTER pressure differential switch is illuminated in flight or while the engine is operating. </li>
    <li>If ingestion of FOD (birds, debris) is suspected.</li>
    <li>If operating in an excessively dusty or dirty environment. </li>
</ul>

<p>Regular cleaning of the air filter element will increase filter and engine performance. </p>

<p><b>Inspection:</b></p>
<p>Visually inspect for holes or ruptures in the filter element. Visually inspect for excessive dirt and debris 
and clean / re-oil as required. </p>

<p><b>Filter Cleaning and Oiling Procedure:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Remove air filter from aircraft.</li>
    <li>Remove debris that can be easily separated from the filter element with a soft brush or vacuum.

        Liberally spray or soak filter assembly (both sides) with Donaldson Air Filter Cleaner 
        (Donaldson P/N 100205-000 or 100201-000). Allow to soak for approximately 30 
        minutes. After 30 minutes, rinse the filter with low pressure water.  When the water running out of the filter is clear, the process is complete. Shake out 
        as much residual water as possible without damaging the filter.

    </li>
    <li>
        Inspect the media for damage or holes by shining a bright 
        light through the element. Inspect pleat structure, pleats shall be of regular pitch and 
        shape. If required, pleats may be carefully re-formed with a 
        hand seamer. After re-forming, inspect for mesh damage. If 
        damage exists, discard filter assembly. Holes larger than 1/32 inch will allow excessively large particulates through to the 
        engine so the filter should be repaired or discarded, see Section 5. If the filter element 
        has holes larger than 1/2 inch, the filter element shall be discarded.

        Evenly apply <b>22 fl. oz.</b> of Donaldson Air Filter Oil (Donaldson P/N 100105-000 or 100101-000) 
        onto both sides of the filter element.  Air Tractor packages and offers this oil as P/N SK1038-4.  
        Allow at least 30 minutes for the oil to wick and migrate throughout the filter element. 
        Inspect filter element for non-wetted areas. Locally apply up to 2 more fl. oz. Observe 
        for any excess oil in the wire mesh or that is not entrapped in the cotton material, 
        slowly wipe with a paper towel to remove excess.

                A low-pressure paint sprayer may be a convenient tool for applying the Air Filter 
                Oil. If applying with a bottle and nozzle, the most efficient method is to apply a small 
                stream on the peak of each pleat, flip the filter and repeat.

<p><b>Repairs:</b></p>
<p>
    Holes or ruptures between 1/32 inch and 1/2 inch in the air filter element may be repaired and 
    sealed with two part sealant (AMS-3276 or MIL-S-8802, examples: PPG PRC-DeSoto PR-1422 
    or PPG PRC-DeSoto P/S 890 “Pro-Seal”). Loose wires or loose sealant on the engine side of 
    the filter pose a threat to the engine and are therefore unacceptable. If a hole or rupture 
    penetrates entirely through the filter element, sealant must be applied to both sides. If a hole or 
    rupture does not penetrate the engine side mesh, sealant need only be applied to the affected 
    side.

<p>
    When applied, sealant must completely fill the hole. Sealant must also be applied in the 
    surrounding vicinity to ensure structural integrity approximately as shown below.

<p><b>Limitations:</b></p>
<p>Owner's Manual supplement 04-0167 provided a single airworthiness limitation:</p>

<p class="tabOver">The Air Filter Assembly shall be replaced after no more than 15 cleaning and re-oiling cycles.</p>

<p>This life limit is incorporated into the recommended life limit section of this manual.  See <xref sectionTarget="2.200.1" prependLabel="Section">Cross Reference Placeholder</xref></p>
