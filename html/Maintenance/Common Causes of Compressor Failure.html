    <li>Compressor Overheated
        <p>Overheating is most often caused by loss of refrigerant charge. Cool suction side refrigerant returning from the
            evaporator provides cooling for the compressor. Once the refrigerant charge is lost there is no refrigerant
            entering
            the compressor, hence no compressor cooling. Blockages in the system will also prevent cool refrigerant flow to
            the
            compressor.</p>

        <p>There are several types of contamination. The most common types are:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Foreign material like metal chips, dirt and desiccant. Resulting in broken internal compressor components
                eventually
                locking up the compressor</li>
            <li>Moisture from improper evacuation or hose permeation. Moisture will corrode internal parts resulting in
                failure.
                Moisture will create higher system pressures or freeze in the expansion device and blocking refrigerant
                flow.

    <li>Clutch Slippage
        <p>The compressor clutch is simply two friction surfaces forced together, like a set of brakes. Each time the clutch
            is engaged some amount heat is generated. If the engagements occur rapidly or the system voltage is to low,
            excessive heat created will cause failure of bearing seals and or melting of the field coil epoxy.</p>

    <li>Handling or Impact Damage

        <p>Striking, dropping or over torque will result in these types of damage:</p>
