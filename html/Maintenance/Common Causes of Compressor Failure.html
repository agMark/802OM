    <li>Compressor Overheated</li>
    <p>Overheating is most often caused by loss of refrigerant charge. Cool suction side refrigerant returning from the
        evaporator provides cooling for the compressor. Once the refrigerant charge is lost there is no refrigerant
        entering
        the compressor, hence no compressor cooling. Blockages in the system will also prevent cool refrigerant flow to
        the
        compressor.</p>
    <li>Compressor Contaminated</li>
    <img class="imageCentered_3x2" src="img/imgTemplate_3x2.png">
    <p>There are several types of contamination. The most common types are:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Foreign material like metal chips, dirt and desiccant. Resulting in broken internal compressor components
            eventually
            locking up the compressor</li>
        <li>Moisture from improper evacuation or hose permeation. Moisture will corrode internal parts resulting in
            failure.
            Moisture will create higher system pressures or freeze in the expansion device and blocking refrigerant
            flow.
        </li>
        <li>Air Conditioning system flush</li>

    <li>Clutch Slippage</li>
    <p>The compressor clutch is simply two friction surfaces forced together, like a set of brakes. Each time the clutch
        is engaged some amount heat is generated. If the engagements occur rapidly or the system voltage is to low,
        excessive heat created will cause failure of bearing seals and or melting of the field coil epoxy.</p>
    <li>Handling or Impact Damage</li>
    <p>Striking, dropping or over torque will result in these types of damage:</p>
