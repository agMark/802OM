<p>The following are Air Tractor's recommendations on performing ground engine runs.  These recommendations apply to all Air Tractor aircraft: </p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>It is recommended that the hopper be filled with water prior to performing ground runs. </li>
    <li>The airplane should be positioned on the tie-down such that FOD/prop wash damage to other aircraft, structures, personnel, or equipment will not occur, nor be directed at or across an active runway.  Also pay close attention to the ground surface below the propeller arc.  Sand, gravel, dirt, tools, debris, etc. can be picked up by the prop and can cause damage to the propeller blades. </li>
    <li>The ideal tie-down anchor is a steel loop or eye set in concrete.  A 24" diameter x 24" tall column of concrete buried 36" in the ground is usually adequate.  Soft or sandy soil may require additional concrete. </li>
    <li>The airplane should be tied down at the tail using a polyester or nylon tow strap or lift strap looped around the tailwheel housing attach block and routed through the tailwheel fork.  See Figure 1 below for a suggested strap routing.  Exercise extreme caution that the tie-down strap does not contact the steering pin mechanism at any time during the ground run.  Tie-down strap should be minimum 5000 lbs. breaking strength.  The airplane should be positioned as close as possible to the tie-down anchor to provide sufficient vertical tension in the tie-down strap. </li>
    <li>Chocks should be removed to prevent the aircraft from rotating on the main wheels and nosing into the ground in the event of tie-down and/or brake failure. â€¯Personnel conducting the ground run should anticipate forward movement of the aircraft in this event. </li>
    <li>Only qualified personnel should conduct the ground runs.   </li>
    <li>The airplane brakes should be set or held during the ground run. </li>
    <li>The control stick should be held full aft (nose up) during the ground run. </li>
</ol>
