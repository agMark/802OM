<p>To remove the starter generator:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Disconnect cables.
    </li>
    <li> 
        One mechanic is to maintain the alignment of the starter-generator by holding the 
        unit in position by keeping the starter generator mounting surfaces flush with the 
        Quick Attach/Detach adapter (QAD pad), while the other mechanic loosens and 
        removes the 'V' band clamp.
    </li>
    <li>
         Carefully remove the starter-generator from the QAD pad by maintaining the 
        spline's alignment to prevent binding of the starter-generator driveshaft.
    </li>
</ol>
