    <ol type="1">
        <li>Re-install actuator in aircraft in reverse order as removal. </li>

        <li>Raise flaps to full up position with flap switch in cockpit. Check position of flaps relative to wing (See <xref sectionTarget="2.30.3" prependLabel="Section"></xref>).</li>

        <li>With flaps properly positioned with respect to the lower side of the wing, there should be a gap 1/16" to 1/8" between the ball nut and the actuator grease case. If the gap is not within the proper range, use the flap switch in the cockpit to provide the proper gap. It will then be necessary to set the flap position with respect to the lower wing surface by adjusting the flap pushrods. </li>

        <li>Loosen the two screws holding the UP micro-switch and adjust the micro-switch until a click is heard. Tighten the two screws and once more use the flap switch to lower and then raise the flaps to the full UP position. Again check the gap between the ball nut and end of the UP travel for 1/16" to 1/8" travel. Check the position of the flaps with respect to the lower wing surface. If all is in order, proceed to set the DOWN micro-switches. </li>

        <li>Extend the flaps to 30Â° and adjust the micro-switch until a click is heard. Re-cycle the flaps and check DOWN travel again. </li>
        
        <li>Re-check the position of the UP micro-switch two ways: Raise the flaps all the way with the flap switch.  After the flaps are fully retracted, continue to hold the flap switch up and observe the Voltmeter. If the Voltmeter shows excessive voltage drop, the micro-switch has not turned OFF 	the current. If this check is OK, then check the distance between the striker and the end of the UP travel, which should be 1/16" to 1/8" as, mentioned in steps 3 and 4. </li>
