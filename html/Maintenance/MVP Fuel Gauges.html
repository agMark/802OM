    The MVP-50T system requires a calibration or mapping of the sender signal to the amount of gallons that are in the tank.  Air Tractor has developed calibration curves for all of the produced fuel tank sizes.  Contact Air Tractor Customer Service to obtain calibration data and instructions.  Loading the MVP-50T system with these data will usually work well but a custom calibration is occasionally required.

    Should the standard calibration not produce accurate indications for any reason, a manual calibration should be performed.  Consult the MVP-50T Operating Instructions (Document OI 1206061).  The procedure will involve jacking the airplane into a flight attitude as previously described then loading in specific fractions of the total capacity.
