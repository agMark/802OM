<p>To remove a main wheel, jack the wheel clear of the ground per LIFTING AND JACKING instructions. See Figure 74 for details of the main wheels. Remove the twelve bolts attaching the two halves of each brake assembly. Leave the brake line connected and slide the brake assembly out of the way. Remove the outer snap ring and dust cap, remove the two cotters in the castellated nut, and back off the castellated nut. The wheel can then be pulling free of the axle. </p>

<p>If the tire is to be removed, deflate the tire by removing the air valve stem Schrader valve. Remove the bolts holding the two wheel halves together. Torque wheel bolts 300 inch-pounds at the nut. Inflate to 60 psi. Clean bearings and hand-pack with grease. Before the wheel is re-installed, inspect the cast aluminum torque plate for cracks and check the five axle attach bolts for proper torque (800 inch-pounds at the nut). Wipe axle clean and slide inner grease seal and bearing on axle. Position wheel and tighten castellated axle nut until a slight bearing drag is felt when wheel is turned. Back off nut to nearest castellation and install two MS24665-351 cotters. Position inner grease seal and install snap ring. Install outer dust cap. The cotter head should protrude no more than 1/8‚Äù above the flat for dust cap clearance. Check brake linings for wear and re-install on torque plate. The twelve bolts in each wheel cylinder require 80-85 inch-pounds torque. Safety with MS20995C32 wire. </p>
