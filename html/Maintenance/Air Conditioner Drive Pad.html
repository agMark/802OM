<p>The engine drive pad used to drive the air conditioner compressor is drive pad "C".</p>
<p>There have been three types of engine drive pads.</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Unsealed"??? Dry spline</li>
    <li>"Unsealed" wet spline</li>
    <li>"Sealed" wet spline</li>
</ul>
<p>The term "dry" or "wet" refers to the spline inside the drive pad that the quill shaft engages with.</p>
<p>The term "sealed" and "unsealed" refers the pad being designed to accommodate rotating seals the are intended to keep
    engine oil inside the engine side of the drive pad.</p>

<p>Dry splines are designed to be packed with grease where shown in 
    <xref fileTarget="img_AcDrySpline.png">Cross Reference Placeholder</xref>.
</p>
<p>Wet splines (inside the drive pad) are lubricated with engine oil.</p>

<p>The "unsealed" drive pad configuration is disadvantageous because of its tendency to waste engine oil through the
    drive pad.</p>

<p>The engine build spec can be used to determine if the engine has or has been converted to a "sealed" type. For
    example, a PT6A-67F will have a "sealed" drive pad if the build spec is BS1309 or later.</p>

<p>There are two primary types of drive pad assemblies that bolt onto the engine's drive pad.</p>
<ul>
    <li>with unsealed bearings and oil bath</li>
    <li>with sealed bearings
        <ul>
            <li>quill shaft without o-rings for unsealed drive pad</li>
            <li>quill shaft with o-rings for sealed drive pad</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>51628-1 is lubricated with engine oil and contains an internal bath. Bearing damage will occur if they are not
    properly lubricated with oil. This drive pad assembly may only be used on "unsealed" drive pads.</p>

<p>51628-31 and -34 use sealed bearings and do not require a oil bath. These assemblies both use the 51640-1 quill shaft
    which does not provide an o-ring to keep oil from migrating from the engine into the drive pad and are for use on
    engines with "unsealed" drive pads.</p>

<p>51628-32 and -35 also use sealed bearings and do not require an oil bath. These assemblies are for use with "sealed"
    drive pads and use the 51640-2 quill shaft which provides a sealing o-ring.</p>

<p>The 51628-34 and -35 drive pad assemblies provide a more robust drive shaft which incorporates the pulley.</p>
