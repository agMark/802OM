<p>Hartzell has selected NYCO Lithium Complex Synthetic Grease GN 3058 as their preferred grease for propellers. New propellers have been shipped with this preferred grease since January 1, 2020. New and overhauled propellers have a label specifying which grease is used to lubricate the propeller. It is imperative that technicians refer to this label, when servicing the propeller, to assure they only use the same grease currently in service as defined on the label.</p>
