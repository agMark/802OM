    <p> The taxi-light switch is located on the lower instrument panel. This switch receives its electrical power from either the airplane bus or from the work-light relay. It may be switched to provide power to the coil of the taxi-light relay. This relay, in turn, supplies current to both of the taxi lights. </p>
