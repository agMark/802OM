<b>Voltmeter</b>

<p>The wiring schematic for the Voltmeter is shown in Figure 36. The Voltmeter shows the voltage on the airplaneâ€™s electrical bus. Voltmeter readings may be used to determine the condition of the battery and Starter/Generator. </p>

<p>When the Master Switch is ON, with the Starter/Generator not charging, with no load on the system, the fully-charged battery voltage should be between 24 and 25 volts. When the Starter/Generator is charging, the voltage on the airplane bus should be approximately 27.5 volts.  </p>
