<p>We have found that in many operations, there is no need for the baggage compartment to be installed in the airplane. In many operating environments, debris and/or chemicals such as fertilizer will accumulate under the baggage compartment promoting corrosion. With the baggage compartment removed, this area of the fuselage belly will be more accessible for regular cleaning, and corrosion will be decreased. To remove your baggage compartment, refer to the directions in Service Letter #283.</p>
