<p>The location and style of the flagger is very important as the air flow behind the flagger is disrupted. If the flagger is placed too far inboard on the wing, the air flow over the empennage is disrupted and the stability and control of the aircraft is adversely affected. If the flagger is placed too far outboard, the air flow over the aileron, and directional control, could be adversely affected. Placement of the flagger should be according to the Automatic Flagman installation instructions. </p>

<p>The shape of the nose cone on the flagger is also an important consideration. Do not use flaggers with the "bullet" shaped nose cone. This style of nose cone is more disruptive to the down stream air flow than the "wing hugging" nose pieces. Additionally, do not modify the wing hugging nose cones by cutting the air intake hole larger. If the flagger will not operate properly, check that the flags are loaded correctly and are the proper size. Also check that the nose piece is sealed to the wing properly.</p>

<p>We suggest that you inspect the installation of the Automatic Flagman on your aircraft to insure that the correct model flagger is installed according to the Automatic Flagman instructions.</p>
