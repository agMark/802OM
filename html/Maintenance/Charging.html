<p>The charging system should include electronic scales and a charging station.</p>

<p>There are two ways to charge the system.</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Through the high side with air conditioning system off.
        <p>Charge systems that heat the refrigerant will force the correct charge amount into the system. Once
            the full charge
            has been dispensed the service valve must be closed and the air conditioning system can be started.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Through the low side with the system running.
        <p>With the engine running at flight-idle speed (approximately 75 percent Ng) with the propeller in the
            feathered
            position. The air conditioner master switch is turned ON. The blower switch is turned ON HIGH, and
            the service
            gauges are monitored to see that the reading on the high-pressure gauge is increasing while the
            reading on the
            low-pressure gauge is decreasing. If the gauges fail to behave as specified, turn the air
            conditioner master switch
            OFF, stop the engine, and investigate the cause of the compressorâ€™s failure to engage. If the gauges
            behave
            properly, then charging can continue.</p>
        <p>Refrigerant is introduced into the low-pressure service valve while the compressor is operating. The
            low pressure
            manifold valve should be opened to allow slow increases in pressure in both the high- and -low
            pressure sides of the
            system. This filling should continue until the low-pressure side of the system stabilizes at 28 to
            32 psi and the
            high pressure side is between 200 and 250 psi. The sight-glass on top of the receiver/dryer should
            show clear liquid
            flow without bubbles.</p>
