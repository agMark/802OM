<p>The GCU monitors the S/G output and the Bus Voltage on pins B and A respectively. As the S/G voltage builds up to within approximately .2 volts of the Bus voltage the GCU will output system voltage on the pin H resulting in activation of the LCR. Power of this circuit is derived from pin J, so turning the Generator Switch OFF disables the LCR as well as the S/G. </p>
