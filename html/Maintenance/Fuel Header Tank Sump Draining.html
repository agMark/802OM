<p>Drain the fuel header tank sump DAILY to remove any moisture in the fuel system from condensation or contamination. Draining the sump daily also will prevent the drain valve from freezing up from contact with fertilizer and chemicals. The location and access to this drain is shown below. </p>

<p>For FIREBOSS aircraft with a serial numbers through -0290, if the airplane leans to the right when parked on the ground and water also accumulates in the header tank, it will not be possible to drain all the water in the tank due to the drain being on the left hand side of the tank.

<p>The land version of the AT-802 has a spring landing gear that does not require shock absorbers and therefore is not affected by this issue unless it is parked in a right wing low attitude due to an uneven ground surface. Water in sufficient quantities in the header tank could reach the engine and cause flame-out with an ensuing forced landing. Therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT to take the steps in Service Letter #270 to remedy this potential problem.</p>
