<p>The canopy doors seal against the door frame with X202Bt neoprene sponge. This material has a PSA backing. Be careful not to stretch the strip during installation or it will come loose. </p>

<p>The door frame has a slight inward bow of 1/8" to allow for door deflection outward at high speeds. The low pressure around the canopy causes the doors to bow outward. The door latch should provide a snug door fit, and if it does not, and the weather-strip is in good condition, bend the latch arm that rides on the plated striker plate (p/n 10354-1 (L/H) or -2 (R/H)). </p>

<p>The door glass is attached with 1/16 x 1 1/4 felt with PSA backing (p/n F-7) around the perimeter. The machine screws around the glass are AN526-632-8 and the nuts are AN365-632. Be careful not to over-tighten the screws or the glass will crack. </p>

<p>All AT-802s have emergency door releases on the left-hand door. These doors can be removed by supporting the open door and removing the spring-pins. </p>

<p>The right-hand canopy door may be removed by following these steps: </p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Close and lock the canopy door.</li>
    <li>Remove nuts and washers from hinge bolts.</li>
    <li>Open the door and support it while removing the AN3 hinge bolts. </li>
    <li>Remove the door from the airplane.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cable ties or any tying method should never be used to secure a cockpit door closed in flight. Tying door handles closed will add steps to normal operation of the door handle and may hinder the operation of the emergency door release which would be a safety issue during an emergency. Modifications to the door latch system should be removed.</p>

<p>The door may be replaced by reversing the order of the steps above. </p>
