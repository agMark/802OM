    <p class="boxCautionMediumText">Care should always be taken when the aircraft is lifted to prevent damage to the aircraft or harm to people near it. The hopper should be EMPTY before jacking.</p>

<p>A jack pad is provided with each aircraft for the main gear. This jack pad is to be used for changing or removing a wheel or tire. To install the jack pad, lay a soft rag on the inside so that it will not chip the paint from the main gear leg and slide the jack pad up the lower end of the main gear leg until it is snug. It will be necessary to remove and replace the lower plastic bands that hold the brake line in place. The band is Tyton T150M-0 and should be stocked as a standard spares item. After the jack pad is in place, install the bolt and nut through the pad flanges with the bolt on the top side of the gear leg. This is to keep the pad from spreading apart and slipping. Use a hydraulic bottle jack of adequate capacity to lift the wheel off the ground. Be sure the tail wheel is locked, and chocks are in place on the other main wheel. The hopper should be empty before jacking. </p>

<p>Alternately, to service the main wheel, tires or brakes, the plane may be jacked utilizing a typical tripod general aviation wing jack of at least 3000 lb capacity and the jack point included in the delivery kit.  To accomplish this, remove the main landing gear cuff and expose the main gear spring clamp.  Insert the jack point into the head of the socket head bolt attaching the clamp block.  You may need to place a dab of grease or putty in the socket head of the bolt to temporarily hold the jack point in place.  Position the jack under the jack point and lift the wheel off the ground.  Before lifting the plane be sure the other main gear is chocked and that the tail wheel is locked.  Use caution making sure the jack is stable understanding that the main gear spring deflects latterly as the plane is lifted and lowered. </p>

<p>To jack the tail wheel, place a small board (a short 2x4) under the tail spring about mid-way between the forward spring attach bolt and the main clamp block that attaches the spring to the fuselage. Place the jack on the board and lift the wheel. Be sure the parking brake is set before jacking. </p>

<p>If the tail spring is to be removed or checked for looseness, or have bolts changed, place the hydraulic jack under the point of the L/H stabilizer strut attach fitting that welds to the lower fuselage longeron. Again, be sure the parking brake is set before jacking. </p>

<p>If the main gear springs are to be checked for looseness, replaced, or bolts changed (other than the forward clamp bolt), the aircraft must be lifted with a hoist, as there are no jack points on the wing due to the large deflections of the main gear springs.  A sling should be constructed with each side of the sling attaching to a chain or cable wrapped around the aft end of the engine mount at the firewall. Be sure to wrap rags around the mount structure so as not to scratch the paint, and have the hopper empty before lifting. A three-ton hoist should be used, and as the wheels clear the ground, place an empty 55 gallon drum with sufficient boards under each wing at the tie-down location to steady the aircraft and provide safety in case the hoist should fail. Do not attempt to jack the wings at the tie-down rings. </p>
