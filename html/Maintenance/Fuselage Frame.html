<p>The fuselage frame is made of 4130N tubing. It may be repaired in conventional ways. AC-4313.1A may be used as a guide for repairs to tubing. All fittings are also of 4130N material. The repaired area should be sanded and burned paint should be removed to a point where it can be feather-edged by sanding. A good etching solution would be a mixture of 1/2 fluid oz. of concentrated phosphoric acid in one gallon of isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol). If relative humidity is extremely low, add 1/4 cup of distilled water to the solution. Factory finish is R9006 Air Ag Yellow Epoxy with R3203 converter. See the section on stripping and repainting steel parts for complete instructions. </p>
