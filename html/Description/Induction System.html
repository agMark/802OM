<p>Engine air is drawn in through the inlet scoop, through a barrier type filter and into a sealed plenum which is located between the forward and aft engine firewalls.  There are three different filter installations that Air Tractor has used on AT-802/802A aircraft.  Each of these filter installations is over 99% efficient and cause only a negligible pressure drop due to the ram air pressure developed by the air scoop.</p>
<p>The earliest air filter system used two large, cylindrical commercial truck filters.  These filters are Donaldson p/n P181047 (alternate is P510336).  Aircraft equipped with the Air Tractor Ram Air system have the airscoop moved from the lower side of the engine cowling to the nose of the aircraft, just below the propeller.  This Ram Air configuration may have one of two different filter systems.  The first system uses a pleated filter element made by Donaldson (p/n 52427-16) pleated filter element.  This filter looks like a paper element filter, but is actually synthetic.  The second type of Ram Air filter is a Brackett foam air filter.  This filter is a disposable foam element filter that contains a sticky residue “wettant" that traps and holds dirt and debris.  This is a lightweight, flexible filter that is installed in a stainless steel frame inside the engine plenum.  The part number for the Brackett foam filter is BA-413E.</p>

<p>A pressure differential switch is installed on the top R/H side of the aft firewall with one probe in the engine area and the other probe in the plenum.  At such time that the pressure difference between the air in the engine area and the air in the plenum is 18 +/- ½ inches of water for the PT6A-67AR/-67R/-67F engines, 15 +/- ½ inches of water for all other engines, the air filter light on the instrument panel will come on.  This light has a “push to test" feature and should be checked before the engine is started.</p>
