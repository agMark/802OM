<p>A quadrant on the left-hand side of the cockpit incorporates the Power lever, the Propeller control lever, and the Start control lever. The Power lever has an idle stop and cannot be moved into the reverse range without moving the trigger at the top of the lever forward. Do not allow the power lever to be moved into the reverse range unless the engine is running or else the control linkage could be damaged.</p>
<p>The Start lever has a latch that prevents inadvertent movement below the RUN position that would shut off the fuel in flight. The Start lever should always be in the FLIGHT IDLE position during flight to allow the engine to remain spooled up enough during approach to allow quick acceleration in case a go-around is required. Refer to the Start Procedures in the Flight Manual for proper positioning of the Start lever when starting. It is important to remember that only with the Start lever full back at the most aft stop position is the fuel cut off.</p>
<p>The Propeller lever may be placed in the full forward position during the start sequence for more convenient movement for the Start lever providing the temperatures are warm. For cold weather starts the Prop lever should be aft, as called out in the starting instructions, as initial oil pressure will go to engine bearings instead of the propeller dome.</p>

<p>All engine controls utilize ACCO push-pull cable assemblies. These cable assemblies are p/n 66-3651-2021 and have very little friction and require no lubrication. See <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_13.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> above for the layout of engine controls.</p>
