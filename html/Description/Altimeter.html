<p>The sensitive altimeter consists of an aneroid bellows that drives the two hands on the instrument face to indicate pressure altitude. The small, adjustable dial in the face of the altimeter is called the Kollsman window. It indicates the sea-level pressure that corresponds with the altimeter reading. This dial can be adjusted with the knurled knob on the bezel of the altimeter case.</p>
<p>The altimeter is a direct-reading instrument that senses static pressure at the static pressure ports on either side of the aft fuselage of the AT-802A. The static ports of the AT-802 are on the surface of the boom style pitot static tube.</p>
