<p>The layout of the Ag dispersal system is shown in Figure 10.  The standard spray system includes two and one-half inch stainless plumbing and streamlined extruded aluminum booms. Forty-eight nozzles are incorporated although the boom is drilled and tapped for an additional 48 nozzles if desired. Quick-couplers are used to remove the booms and pump from the aircraft in minutes. The spray pump is an Agrinautics p/n 65715 three-inch capacity pump. The fan is a Weath-Aero F200-144 with adjustable blade angles.  The control valve is an Agrinautics p/n 75501 and the strainer is an Agrinautics p/n 4196H30. The bottom-load valves are Transland three-inch p/n 24445 and 24446.</p>
<p>All hoses used in the spray system have a special lining which is impervious to nearly all chemicals. The hoses are double clamped at all connections with stainless-steel worm-drive clamps. All plumbing parts have beaded ends to provide secure hose attachments.</p>
<p>Spraying Systems Inc. spray nozzles are p/n 4666 diaphragm check valve, p/n 1/8 QJJ body, and p/n Qvv-4010 spray tips. The aircraft is equipped with 4010 spray tips for medium volume applications. For high volume spraying, larger spray tips should be installed. If this does not provide the required flow rates, the pump may be changed to a Transland 4-inch pump. With this pump and with 96 nozzles installed with larger spray tips, flow rates on the order of 300 gallons per minute are possible at pressures of approximately 30 psi.  See Report 1117.</p>
<p>The boom pressure gauge is part of the dispersal monitoring system. Nylon tubing is used to connect the boom pressure gauge to the boom through the lower fuselage skin. </p>
<p>The fan brake lever is an industrial over-center type lever that has considerable leverage to stop the optional Micronair fan instantly. The brake-cable tension can be adjusted in the cockpit by rotating the brake lever handle. The Weath-Aero fan does not require a brake.</p>
<p>Micronair rotary atomizes may be installed if desired. The factory supplies a special boom for 12 atomizers.</p>
