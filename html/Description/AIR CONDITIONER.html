<p>The AT-802 airplane uses a gas-cycle air-conditioning system for climate control.  This versatile air conditioning system allows the pilot to select ram air from outside, or to re-circulate cockpit air, or a combination of the two. The ram-air control handle is located on the aft-cockpit wall, to the right-hand side of the pilot.</p>
<p>The Sanden SD-508 compressor has five reciprocating pistons driven by a rotating wobble-plate. It uses reed-type valves to control flow at the suction and pressure ports. Mechanical power to drive the compressor is taken from an engine accessory drive pad. Gears in the engine drive a splined-quill shaft that turns a small poly “V" groove pulley. This small pulley drives the larger flywheel pulley with a poly “V" belt. This larger drive pulley is connected, through an electromagnetic clutch, to the compressor shaft.</p>
<p>The wiring schematic for this air-conditioning system is shown in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_4.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below. The air conditioner fans, blowers, and compressor clutch are powered by the airplane bus. All control switches for the air conditioning system are located on the pilot's panel. The pilot can use the switches to turn the system ON or OFF and to control the cockpit-blower speed as HIGH, MED, or   LOW.</p>

<p>The air conditioner master switch (A/C Switch) enables all functions of the air conditioner system. This switch may be used to select air-conditioning with blower-forced air circulation without air-conditioning.</p>
<p>The Blower Switch controls the speed of the evaporator blower. The blower is ON any time that the A/C Switch is not OFF. Its speed is controlled HIGH, MED, or LOW with the Blower Switch. </p>
<p>The Trinary Switch, located atop receiver/dryer, does two things to control electrical power to the compressor clutch. A set of contacts in the Trinary Switch protects the compressor by opening the Compressor Clutch circuit any time the system's high pressure is less than 25 psi. This same set of contacts open when the system's high pressure exceeds 350 psi.</p>
<p>The functional layout of this air-conditioning system is shown in Figure 1-2 below. In operation, hot, high pressure refrigerant leaves the pressure port of the compressor and goes directly to the upper inlet of the condenser coil. While in the condenser coil, the refrigerant is cooled at the high pressure. The temperature drop in the condenser coil causes the gas to liquefy. The refrigerant emerges from the bottom of the condenser coil as a warm liquid under high pressure.</p>

<p>The receiver/dryer acts as an accumulator to dampen pressure pulses from the compressor. The receiver/dryer also removes moisture from the system, preventing internal freeze-up of the expansion valve.</p>
<p>The flow of the warm liquid is directed to the cooling unit. This unit consists of an expansion valve, evaporator coil, and an electrically-powered fan.</p>
<p>The expansion valve throttles the flow of warm liquid, dropping its pressure and transforming it to a cold, saturated vapor.</p>
<p>The cold gas proceeds from the expansion valve to the evaporator coil where it is warmed by removing heat from the air that is forced through the coil by an electric fan. This cooled air is directed to the pilot.</p>
<p>The refrigerant leaves the evaporator coil as a warm gas. The gas flow from the cooling unit is returned to the suction port of the compressor where the compressor raises its pressure and temperature. The hot gas leaves the pressure port of the compressor and the process starts over again.</p>
