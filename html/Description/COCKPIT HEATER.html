<p>The heater system taps bleed air off the compressor sections of the engine and routes it to an ON-OFF valve on the left-hand side of the fuselage just forward of the cockpit. This valve may be actuated by pulling up on a cable marked HEAT located below the left side of the pilot’s seat and routed through the cockpit floor.</p>
<p>On the aft side of the valve a line is routed to the diffuser which is located on the cockpit floor on the R/H side. The amount of heat desired may be regulated by pulling the valve partially open or fully open.</p>
<p>To limit power loss in the case of line failure to the valve, the Bleed Valve Outlet Fitting that attaches to the compressor case has a "Choke" welded to the mounting plate. The “Choke" limits the diameter of the compressor tap to .250 inches. </p>
<p>The cockpit heater is very effective even in the coldest conditions and is a requirement for those operators who have winter work.</p>
