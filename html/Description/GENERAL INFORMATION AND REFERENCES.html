<p>The Air Tractor AT-802 or AT-802A is an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane designed especially for agricultural or fire fighting operations. It is powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A turboprop engine which is highly suited for this type of flying. The standard engine for the fire-fighting versions is the PT6A-67AG which is rated at 1350 SHP at sea level and 99Â° F. The PT6A-65AG is a popular optional engine, which is rated at 1295 SHP. Other PT6A engines are optional, including the PT6A-67F which is rated at 1424 SHP.</p>
<p>The propeller is a Hartzell five-blade constant speed prop with reversing capabilities. The -65 series engines have a 115-inch diameter prop and the -67 series have a 118-inch prop. The hopper is made of fiberglass. It has a capacity of 800 U.S. gallons for Ag versions and 820 gallons for fire-fighting versions. The horizontal stabilizer is all metal and strut-braced for added rigidity. The vertical fin is cantilevered. The elevators and rudder are of all-metal construction and sealed to prevent chemical entry. The fuselage features removable skin panels for ease of maintenance and cleaning. High-lift flaps are incorporated to provide short take-off and landing distances.</p>
