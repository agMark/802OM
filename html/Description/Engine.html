<p>The Pratt & Whitney PT6A series of engines have been proven to be one of the most reliable power plants available today. The engine is a lightweight, reverse flow, free turbine engine utilizing two independent turbine sections. One section drives the compressor in the gas generator section and the second drives the propeller shaft through a gear reduction box.</p>
<p>Air enters the engine through an annular plenum chamber, passing through a four-stage axial and one-stage centrifugal compressor. In the combustion chamber, fuel mixed with air is ignited. The expanding gasses are directed through the three turbines and out the exhaust ports on opposing sides of the engine.</p>
<p>The standard engine is a Pratt & Whitney PT67AG turboprop engine for fire-fighting versions. This engine is rated at 1350 SHP for take-off at sea level and 99° F. Maximum torque at take-off is 4170 ft-lbs. Maximum ITT for take-off  is 800° C. Maximum Ng is 104% for take-off. Maximum Np for all operations is 1700 RPM. See the flight manual for other engine limits and special conditions.  Optional engine for FIREBOSS 802s is the PT6A-67F, (torque 4400 ft-lb, ITT 870° C, RPM 1700, NG 104%).</p>
<p>The standard engine for the Ag models is the PT6A-65AG (Torque 4000 ft-lb, ITT 820° C, RPM 1700, NG 104%).  For long engine life it is recommended that the ITT is kept well below the maximum limits. Use only enough power on take-off to operate safely from the strip being used.</p>
<p>Read the engine maintenance manual for instructions as to the care and servicing of your engine. Refer to “Instructions for Continued Airworthiness" in Section 1 of this manual.</p>
