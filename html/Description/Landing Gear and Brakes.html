<p>Landing Gear 
Spring type main and tail landing gear are used on the Air Tractor airplanes. This type of landing gear provides a minimum of maintenance, low drag and considerable energy absorption for hard landings. In addition, a smooth ride is provided for operations from rough strips.</p>
<p>The main gear axles are made of 4130N steel, and cadmium plated for corrosion protection. Tapered aluminum shims are used between the axle and the main gear leg to provide the proper camber and toe-in. The main gear wheels are Cleveland p/n 40-279A with a 11.00-12 10-ply rating tire installed. Main wheel tire inflation pressure is 60 psi (unloaded) or 62 psi (loaded).</p>
<p>The tail wheel is a Cleveland 40-140C. A grease fitting provided in the side of the wheel is used to grease the bearings.</p>
<p>The tail wheel tire is 17.5X6.25-6 10-ply rating. Tire pressure is 60 psi loaded or unloaded.  The tube is 6.00-6.</p>
<p>The tail wheel fork is of welded 4130N tubing construction and is heat treated for strength. A bronze bushing and a tapered roller bearing are incorporated where the fork enters the tail wheel housing. A tail wheel locking mechanism is provided and the tail wheel may be unlocked by pushing the control stick forward. This lifts the stainless locking pin out of the tail wheel fork and allows the tail wheel assembly to swivel 360Â°  . If during taxi the aircraft tends to steer to the left or to the right with the controls neutral, it is possible to readjust the lock pin position by loosening the 4 screws that attach the lock pin housing to fork housing plate. The lock pin can then be moved in the desired direction and the screws tightened.</p>
<p>Brake System 
Brakes are the same, left or right, and are Cleveland p/n 30-210A. The brake cylinders are Cleveland p/n 10-86A. Brake fluid is the conventional red petroleum-base Mil-H-5606A fluid. The brake fluid reservoir is a p/n 411611311A and is mounted on top of the lower instrument panel where the fluid level is always visible. The parking brake valves are Scott p/n 4500A-2. Stratoflex hoses are used from the pressure side of the master cylinder to the parking brake valve and stainless steel lines are routed from the valve to the bulkhead fitting of the master cylinder to the parking brake valve and stainless steel lines are routed from the valve to the bulkhead fitting next to the main landing gear. A high-pressure Stratoflex hose connects the bulkhead fitting to the wheel cylinders. The schematic of the brake system is shown in Figure 23. </p>
