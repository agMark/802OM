<p>The ailerons are of all-metal construction and hinged on ball bearings. The bellcranks and pushrod ends operate on ball bearings, producing smooth operation and low system friction. The stick forces are light and the ailerons are very responsive. The light stick forces are a result of the installation of aerodynamic servo tabs installed on the outboard end of each aileron.</p>
<p>Each aileron has a large balance weight on the outboard end of the aileron just forward of the leading edge. These weights must never be removed as they are necessary for flutter prevention.</p>
