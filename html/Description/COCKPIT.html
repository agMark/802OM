<p>The AT-802 or AT-802A has exceptional visibility on the ground as well as in the air. The windshield is three-piece, the two corner pieces being Plexiglas while the flat center piece is automotive safety-plate glass. Cockpit entry is made through either of two large canopy doors. A wire deflector is incorporated into the windshield support structure. The cockpit layout and details are shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_5.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>, <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_6.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>, and <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_7.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>.</p>

<p>The rudder pedals may be adjusted on the ground by removing the T-pin and sliding the rudder pedals in the aluminum channel to the desired position and reinserting the T-pin. </p>
<p>The seat is fixed in one vertical position at the factory. However, the operator may raise or lower the seat if desired by removing the two pins and resetting them in the factory pre-drilled holes. The seat structure is of welded 4130N tubing, oiled internally, and sand-blasted, primed, and painted. The covers are removable and may be changed as required. The covers are of a coarse mesh material for comfort during hot weather. A special installation tool is required for installing new covers and may be borrowed from the local Air Tractor dealer. At the bottom extreme seat bucket, a tubular structure supports a thick Ensonite seat pad.</p>
<p>A three inch-wide-safety belt is attached to the seat structure. The shoulder harness is attached to the primary fuselage structure behind the cockpit. The shoulder harness is a necessary part of the restraint system and must always be worn.</p>
<p>If the aircraft is equipped with AmSafe Airbags, these airbags are built into the shoulder harnesses.  The airbag system is equipped with its own internal battery, so it is always active.  There is no pilot action necessary to arm or operate the system.  The airbag system requires the use of the installed crotch strap for proper pilot protection.</p>
<p>The control lock is located under the instrument panel. It hinges up to engage the tang on the control stick, effectively locking the aileron and elevator surfaces.</p>
<p>The instrument panels are in two sections, with the upper panel containing the instruments most often used during flight. A large hopper window between the panels allows the pilot to determine the amount of dry fertilizer or seed remaining in the hopper. The instruments are described individually in <xref sectionTarget="1.85" prependLabel="Section"></xref></p>
<p>A stall warning horn is provided. The stall warning lift detector, on the left-hand wing, is set to activated the horn at approximately 5 miles per hour above stall. A hopper quantity gauge is installed on the right-hand side of the upper instrument panel. This gauge is marked to read in U.S. gallons with the aircraft in switch-selectable ground attitude or flight attitude. In addition, hopper quantity gauges are located above each bottom loading valve, at the lower side of the fuselage, where they are visible to ground crew.</p>
<p>The hopper window in the rear wall of the hopper is supported by an aluminum frame. It is sealed with PS890 B-2 sealer that is impervious to most chemicals and is available through Air Tractor dealers.</p>
<p>The cockpit has aluminum enclosure skins and control push-rod boots that insolate the cockpit from the rest of the aircraft and prevent the entry of most chemicals. If the aircraft is to be used for dusting, special modifications are required. See the Airplane Flight Manual for complete instructions on dust applications and modifications..</p>
