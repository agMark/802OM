<p>The airspeed indicator is an aneroid-driven instrument that displays the indicated airspeed of the airplane. The instrument contains two aneroid bellows that are used to compare the total pressure at the pitot tube with the static pressure at the airplane's static ports. The result of this comparison yields the pure dynamic pressure obtained by subtracting the static pressure from total pressure. This dynamic pressure is used to drive the hand on the face of the dial with divisions shown in miles per hour or knots.</p>
