<p>AT-802 and AT-802A aircraft, beginning with s/n 802-0072 are equipped with a low fuel warning system. This system consists of a pair of float switches, one mounted in the inboard end of each wing tank. The switches are wired either in parallel to a single caution indicator light located on the upper instrument panel or to two separate indicator lights.</p>
<p>When the low fuel warning light first flickers on, during straight level constant speed flight, there is approximately 20 minutes total fuel remaining. This 20 minutes will vary depending on aircraft attitude and engine power setting.</p>
