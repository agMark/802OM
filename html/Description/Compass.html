<p>The magnetic compass is a direct-reading instrument that senses the azimuth difference in airplane heading and a bearing to magnetic North. This difference is displayed at the lubber line of the compass as magnetic heading.</p>
<p>The compass is swung at the factory and a card is attached that shows the compass error at cardinal headings. The compass deviation is measured with radios and lights OFF. Operation of lights, radios, or other electrical equipment may cause significant error in the compass.</p>
