<p>The elevator-flap interconnect system assists with maintaining pitch while the flaps are lowered.</p>
<p>The aft idler in the elevator control system is attached to the aft end of the elevator down spring.  The forward end of the down spring is attached to a stainless-steel cable that is routed to a pulley system located below the cockpit.  The lower pulley in this system is mounted to a fuselage mounted bellcrank.  A pushrod connects the bellcrank to an arm mounted on the flap torque tube.</p>
<p>When the flaps are lowered, pulley mounted on the bellcrank lowers which pulls the cable forward.  The cable pulls the forward end of the down spring which increases the nose down force that is applied to the elevator control system.</p>
