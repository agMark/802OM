<p>The wing structure is full cantilever, with the main spar carrying all of the bending loads. Construction is of 2024-T3 Alclad for skins and spar webs. The upper spar cap and the lower spar cap are made of alloy steel for long fatigue life. The wing has a constant chord of 81.4 inches and a span of 59.25 ft. The wing utilizes a NACA  4415 wing section and has 2.5 degrees of washout twist which results in gentle stall characteristics.</p>
<p>The leading edge is extra heavy with a leading edge double bonded internally to minimize denting from bird strikes. Each wing panel has the leading edge divided into five different pieces to allow easy replacement. Universal head rivets are used to facilitate the removal and replacement of leading edge sections.</p>
<p>The fuel tanks are located in the inboard section of the wing and are an integral part of the structure. The closely riveted seams and heavy skins make them burst resistant in the event of a crash. Sealing is accomplished by an application of Product Research PR-1422A2 sealing compound. The inboard end of the wing is sealed against chemical entry and the aileron pushrod has a flexible boot attached to prevent entry of chemical at the pushrod location. A complete wire bundle for night working lights is installed inside every wing during assembly.</p>
<p>Both spar caps are cadmium plated and painted with an epoxy paint for corrosion protection. All other parts inside the wing are treated with Alodine and primed with zinc chromate primer prior to assembly.</p>
