<p>Volt-Ammeter- The AT-802 or AT-802A with the optional 250 Amp electrical system is equipped with a Volt-Ammeter. This dual-scale gauge normally reads generator-output amperage. Voltage may be read by pressing the button on the bezel of the instrument.</p>
<p>This conventional meter reads system Voltage from the airplane's electrical bus.</p>
<p>The Ammeter function of the Volt-Ammeter receives its signal from the precision 50-milli-Ohm shunt in the generator output circuit. The Ammeter measures the Voltage drop across the shunt. This Voltage drop is proportional to the current  flowing through the shunt, so the meter displays the current units (Amps) that correspond to the drop in Voltage.</p>
<p>Voltmeter- The AT-802 or AT-802A with the standard 150 Amp electrical system is equipped with a Voltmeter. This conventional meter reads system Voltage from the airplane's electrical bus.</p>
