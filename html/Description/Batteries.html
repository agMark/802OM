<p>The three batteries used in the 802/802A are Teledyne Gill Electric p/n G-246AT. They are wired in parallel for extra cranking power. The Amp-hour rating of the three batteries combined is 63 amp-hours. The batteries are 24- Volt lead-acid batteries. A ground start receptacle is installed on the left-hand side of the lower cowling. An external power supply should be used for starting at any time the batteries have a charge of less than 24 volts. Fully charged batteries should allow the gas generator to peak at about 18% Ng before the Start control lever is advanced to the RUN position. At this high of an Ng speed, a cool start is possible which is desirable.</p>
