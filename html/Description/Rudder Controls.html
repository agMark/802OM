<p>The rudder controls consist of stainless-steel cables that are connected between the rudder pedals and the rudder-control horn. The rudder stops are located at the rudder horn.  There is a spring loaded interconnect system between the rudder and the aileron systems that eases turn coordination. This interconnect also allows banking the aircraft with rudder application alone. </p>
<p>The layout of the rudder-control system is shown below in <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_9.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref>. </p>
