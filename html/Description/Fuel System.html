<p>Standard aircraft have two fuel tanks with a capacity of 127 U.S. gallons each for a total of 254 gallons. Both tanks gravity feed into a small header tank which is located behind the chemical hopper and between the wing rear spar attach parts. Optional fuel capacities are 308 gallons or 380 gallons.</p>
<p>The fuel valve handle is located within easy reach of the pilot and is marked MAIN and OFF. There can be no tank selection since both tanks are interconnected. The fuel valve is placarded in GALLONS USABLE. This is due to the fact that the fuel tank sender does not allow the last 4 gallons to be gauged. The fuel gauge receiver, which is located on the instrument panel, is marked in fractions of usable fuel.</p>
<p>Finger strainers of coarse wire mesh are located in each fuel tank. Fuel flows from the wing tanks into the header tank, through the fuel valve and to the airplane firewall. From the firewall, a fuel line is connected to a large fuel filter.  This filter does not incorporate a fuel filter bypass design feature.  A vacuum pressure switch is connected to the outlet side of the filter.  If the filter becomes clogged, the switch will close and the “FUEL FILTER" warning light will illuminate in the cockpit.</p>
<p>The fuel lines continue from the firewall mounted fuel filter to the airframe pump, which is mounted on an engine accessory drive pad. This pump is an  Air Tractor p/n 51076-1, set for CCW rotation.</p>
<p>The fuel lines continue from the airframe pump to the fuel heater body. Lines from that point on are furnished with the engine.</p>
<p>There are five quick drains in the fuel system one in each wing tank, two in the header tank and one in the fuel valve.</p>
<p>Each fuel tank has an overboard vent located near the wing tip. With both tanks completely full, it is possible during flight to vent a small amount of fuel overboard by skidding the aircraft or rolling sharply. A check valve located next to the outboard fuel-tank wall greatly reduces the amount of fuel vented overboard during maneuvers.</p>
<p>Fuel type is called out in the Flight Manual.  Fuel System Icing Inhibitor (FSII) such as Prist should be added to the fuel at a rate to provide .06% to .15% of FSII by volume when operating below 40° F. See <xref fileTarget="img_Fig_22.png" xrefType="link">Fig Cross Reference</xref> below for details of the fuel system.</p>
