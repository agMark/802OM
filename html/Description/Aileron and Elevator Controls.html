<p>Push-pull tubes are used in both the aileron and elevator system. Rod-end bearings are installed in each push-rod to minimize control system friction. The torque tube mounted on the cockpit floor is supported at each end with bearings. These bearings have grease fittings so that grease may be applied as necessary. As these bearings wear, fore and aft slack may develop. This slack can be removed with the addition of shims made of .010-inch-thick steel. These shims are added to the forward end of the torque tube. The stops for the elevator control system are located on each side of the elevator horn. The aileron control stops are welded to the cockpit-floor structure at the forward end of the torque tube. Both the aileron and the elevator down stops employ neoprene washers that act as shock absorbers for the system.</p>
