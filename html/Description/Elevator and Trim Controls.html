<p><b>Elevator and Trim Controls</b></p>
<p>Elevator and trim are the primary and secondary controls for changing pitch in flight. The elevator is controled from the stick, pulling control cables to articulate the horizontal stabilizer.
     Moving the stick forwards and backwards will pitch the nose of the airplane down and up respectively. Unlike roll and yaw controls, elevators are not spring loaded. </p>
<p>The Air Tractor has trim for both pitch and yaw. Pitch trim is used to adjust steady level stick forces at specific airspeed, altitude and power settings. Elevator trim are operated by wheels on the left hand side of the pilot.
     Through a series of control cables, the wheel sets the trim tab to hold each control surface.  </p>
