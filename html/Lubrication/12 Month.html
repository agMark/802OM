    <li>Leaving the control rods attached, remove the boost-tab pivot assemblies at the outboard

        Grease all of the tab-pivots and oilite bearings. Replace the boost surfaces and their
        associated tab pivots.</li>

<p>*This is not required on engines having wet spline configuration. There are two ways you can determine if
    your engine is set up for the wet spline starter-generator. The easiest is to check the part number of the
    starter-generator. If it is p/n 23048-028, 23078-020, 250SG111Q-2-1, or 300SGL153Q-1, then it is a wet spline
    starter-generator. An alternate way to determine if your engine is set up for the wet spline starter-generator is to
    inspect the starter-generator drive gear spline. The starter-generator must be removed to accomplish this. If
    the internal drive gear spline starts at the aft end of the gear, the engine is set up for the dry spline
    starter-generator. If the internal spline starts approximately 1/2 inch into the bore of the drive gear, the engine
    is set
    up for the wet spline starter-generator.</p>
