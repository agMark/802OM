    Air Tractor airplanes are not certificated for instrument flight nor flight where visibility is limited. 
However, should flight into a thunderstorm be inadvertently experienced, the first consideration is to maintain 
control of the airplane.
</p>

<p>
    Since flight attitude changes in a thunderstorm are sharp and often quickly reversed, care should be 
taken to avoid over-correction of the controls. The application of control forces should be small, steady and 
deliberate.
</p>

<p>
    Without flight instruments that provide greater horizontal-situation information, the magnetic compass 
and altimeter become the primary flight instruments. Airspeed is a secondary indication of pitch. The airplane 
should be held on a straight-and-level flight path until an exit from the clouds is sighted. Holding a compass 
heading and altimeter steady will reduce the likelihood of encountering unusual flight attitudes.
</p>

<p>
    Changes in airspeed are indications of nose-up or nose-down attitudes, but they should be interpreted 
with altimeter information. Strong vertical currents within the cloud can cause sharp increases or decreases 
of altitude. An increase in airspeed with an accompanying reduction of altitude or a decrease in airspeed with 
an increase in altitude calls for changes in the airplane's pitch. However, increases in both altitude and 
airspeed or decreases in both altitude and airspeed call for power adjustments to maintain the desired flight 
path.

<p>
    Do not attempt to turn around to exit the cloud cell at the point of entry. Considering the time spent in 
the turn and the horizontal depth of the cell, the cloud will likely be exited in less time on a steady course than 
if turns are made.

<p>
    Lightning strikes that contact the airplane may carry large currents through the structure that can melt 
mechanical fasteners, fuse bearings and burn wires. This phenomenon is particularly critical regarding flight control surfaces and control linkages.
</p>

<p>
    All hinges that support flight-control surfaces and all bearings in the flight, engine, and propeller-control 
systems should be inspected for looseness or roughness. Bearing damage may be shown by burn marks or 
smoky residue next to the bearings. Bearings found damaged should be replaced.
</p>

<p>
    Damage to the electrical system is usually associated with failure of an electrical component. All 
terminal blocks should be visually inspected for damage. Wire bundles next to structure should be inspected 
for a breakdown of the wing insulation. This is usually accompanied by burn or smoke marking the point of a 
breakdown. All damaged electrical components should be replaced.
</p>

<p>
    Considerations for turbulence in a thunderstorm and post-flight inspections for structural damage are 
the same as for flight into turbulent air.
