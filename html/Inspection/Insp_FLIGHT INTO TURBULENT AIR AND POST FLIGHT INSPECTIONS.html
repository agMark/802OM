<p>
When unusually turbulent air conditions are encountered, certain precautions should be taken. A 
post-flight inspection should be conducted to learn if structural damage has occurred.    
</p>

<p>
Upon entering rough air, the airspeed should be slowed to the maneuvering speed VA at the existing 
airplane gross weight. The flight altitude should be adjusted to below 1200 feet or above 4000 feet since the 
more severe turbulence in the air mass will occur between these levels.
</p>

<p>
In extremely severe turbulence, with safety considerations allowing, the hopper contents should be 
jettisoned to reduce structural loads and to allow a further reduction in airspeed.
</p>

<p>
Post-flight inspections after encountering turbulent air should include all of the items in the 
PREFLIGHT, WALK-AROUND INSPECTION section of the AIRPLANE FLIGHT MANUAL.
</p>

<p>
    Wrinkled skins are the best indication of structural damage to the fuselage, wings, empennage, and 
control surfaces. Loose rivets may be identified by paint cracks around their heads. Fairings at the wing root 
should be inspected for misalignment. Ailerons, flaps, and elevator should be checked for symmetric alignment 
with wings and empennage.
</p>

<p>
    The security of all equipment beneath the cowling and fuselage skins should be established. Large 
mass items such as batteries, tanks, pumps, and motors should be inspected for security of mounting.
