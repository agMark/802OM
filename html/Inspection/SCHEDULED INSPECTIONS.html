<p>This manufacturer inspection program provides for the complete inspection of the aircraft each 12 calendar months.</p>
<p>This manufacturer inspection program is required by 14 CFR §91.409(f)(3) and must include all 6 Month and 12 Month items, all 100-, 200-, & 300-hour items, applicable airworthiness directives, service letters, service information letters and those items listed in applicable engine, propeller, and appliance maintenance manuals <span style="color: red;">(Refer to Section 1 – General – Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA's) -  LIST OF MANUALS AND DOCUMENTS).</span></p>
<p>All months referenced in this section are “calendar" months. (For example: If the 12-month inspection was completed on January 10, 2025, the next 12-month inspection is due no later than January 31, 2026).</p>
<p>The operator may choose to perform the 100-, 200-, and 300-hour inspection items in conjunction with the 12-month inspection. Alternatively, the operator may choose to perform the 100-, 200-, and 300-hour inspection items in accordance with the procedures listed in the Hourly Inspections and Interval Tolerance listed below, again, if these items are inspected at least each calendar year.</p>
<p>All other applicable calendar and hourly inspection items must be accomplished when they become due.</p>
<p><u>Hourly Inspections and Interval Tolerance</u> – The 100-, 200-, and 300-hour inspections are line maintenance inspections. This work can be accomplished by simple means and does not require extensive disassembly or elaborate inspections. Air Tractor recommends the 100-, 200-, and 300-hour inspections be performed at the intervals shown, within a tolerance window of +/- 15 hours. Do not add or subtract the times within this tolerance to the next scheduled inspection. (For example: If the 100-hour inspection item was due at 5400 hours, and the inspection was performed at 5385-5415 hours, the next 100-hour inspection item remains due at 5500 hours). Inspections performed outside of this tolerance will require a new next-due calculation. For all other applicable intervals (400, 800, 900, 1000, 1350, 2000, 5000 etc.), the interval shown is the maximum (no +/- 15-hour tolerance).</p>

<p>Air Tractor recognizes that owners often want or need to modify their airplanes to fit their needs. Many of the modifications are items of equipment offered from the factory, or equipment that is offered in the aftermarket. When looking to modify your plane, you should be reminded that modifications to an airplane must have an appropriate airworthiness approval. The US FAA formally calls modifications "alterations" and places them in two categories; minor alterations and major alterations. In general, any alterations must have approved data. In some minor alteration cases acceptable data is all that is required. </p>

<p>Maintenance to your plane is to be accomplished by or under the direct supervision of an authorized person or entity and is to be returned to service before the plane is operated. Inspections are to be accomplished by an appropriately rated person or entity and must determine that the plane is in airworthy condition. To be in airworthy condition the plane must meet the type design, the approved design from the factory, and or be altered in accordance with approved data.</p>
