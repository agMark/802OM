    For unscheduled inspections affecting the engine or propeller, refer to the applicable engine and/or 
propeller maintenance manuals. Some engine mounted accessories are not covered in the engine or propeller 
manuals, such as the overspeed governor and starter-generator. If the engine exceeds operating limitations 
or is subjected to unusual operating conditions, these items may be affected and will need to be inspected to 
ensure proper operation and lack of damage.
