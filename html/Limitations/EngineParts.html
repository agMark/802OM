    No. 19, or later revision, describes the life limited components, and their limits for the PT6A-45 series 
    engines. Service Bulletin 13002 Revision No. 9, or later revision, describes the life limited components, and 
    their limits for the PT6A-65 series engines. Service Bulletin 14002 Revision No. 5, or later revision, describes 
    the life limited components, and their limits for the PT6A-67 series engines. As outline in these service 
    bulletins operators are required to keep records of accumulated total cycles and all starts and flights for their 
    engines to determine when the service life of life limited components has expired.</p>
